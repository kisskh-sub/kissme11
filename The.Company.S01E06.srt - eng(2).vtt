(Yashe)

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.280
Yashe?

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.630
Open the door!

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.680
Is anyone there?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.150
Are you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.520
a customer?

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.590
This is interesting.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:23.800
Are you guys

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.240
not accepting any customers?

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.710
We are.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.750
Please come inside.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.000
How long

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.710
has this shop been operating?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.550
I have no idea.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.840
Aren't you the owner?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.680
I'm not.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.240
He went out for some business.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.990
I'm just watching over
the shop on his behalf.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.310
Take a look around for now.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.030
I don't know about the prices either.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.730
You can inquire about them
when he's back.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.710
Isn't this a Northern Song Dynasty
Ru Ware Sky-Blue Glaze Large Dish?

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.750
There are barely 100 Northern Song Ru
ware pieces left in the world.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.870
How come a tiny shop like this
has one of them?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.150
Is it that rare?

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.710
But I don't see
anything special about it.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.190
We use the same plates
for our meals at home.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.960
But I believe that Mister
won't sell any knockoffs.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.870
People say that
the antique trade is a mixed bag.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.870
I'm sure it's because people like you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.800
spoiled our reputation!

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.590
A Northern Song Dynasty Ru Ware
Sky-Blue Glaze Large Dish?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.680
Listen,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.280
this isn't even a high-quality knockoff!

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.230
If it's genuine,
I'll swallow it in front of you!

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.360
Call your boss here.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.560
I'll reason with him!

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.400
- That's not it...
- Were you looking for me?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.800
Bizhi, you've finally returned.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.470
He said that you sold knockoffs.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.910
Mr. Bi,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.800
I didn't know that this was your shop.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.470
It's impossible for you
to sell knockoffs. I was plain wrong.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.310
There are plenty of treasures here.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.760
Some of them are so rare
that I don't even know their names.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.100
Is that made of agarwood?

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.800
It is, huh?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.030
I was wondering about the fragrant scent
upon entering the shop.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.120
This is excellent.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.120
It's quite expensive.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.240
No.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.870
This can no longer be measured in money.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.960
It's such a huge piece.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.840
Have some tea.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.680
Okay.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.280
Just look at the tea cup.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.510
It has a crystal-clear warmth
and a rouge-like purple tint to it.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.240
Don't tell me

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.360
it's a piece of Jun Kiln.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.000
Really?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.560
How could you use this for tea?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.950
We have to frame it and worship it,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.790
you know?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.750
Mr. Bi,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.830
to be honest with you,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.670
I do have

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.560
a tiny collection as well.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.870
If you have the time,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.190
please check them out

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.240
and tell me what you think.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.710
Why don't we head to my place today?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.750
Today?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.160
Yeah, you're right.
I shouldn't trouble you.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.560
I should bring them here
and show them to you instead.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.710
What about this?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.920
I'll go and get them right now.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.240
Please wait for me.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.390
- Just a moment. I'll return soon.
- I...

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.560
Where did you go just now?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.720
Where else?

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.590
I went out to find a present for
that picky person from Tianguang Market.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.500
When you leave, hang up
the "Closed" wooden sign for me.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.950
I'm not leaving.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.630
I wish to head to Tianguang Market
and thank her myself.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.210
I would've had to struggle on that river

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.870
for some time
if it weren't for her back then.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.680
My milk tea order hasn't arrived yet.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.960
I'll order an extra cup for her.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.480
With extra sugar and boba.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.750
Are you sure
you don't need to work today?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.240
I still have some annual leave left.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.560
Besides,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.800
time stands still within
Tianguang Market.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.070
You can also manipulate Yashe

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.560
and make it so that I enter and leave

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.190
at the same time.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.160
And, I can come back to you
when I need extra sleep in the future.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.950
During our search for the Kunwu Blade,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.970
Market Lord,
I didn't present you with any gifts.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.310
This time, I'm making up for it.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.560
This agate is of excellent quality.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.680
It has a fine color as well.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.830
However...

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.360
What's wrong?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.720
I haven't had the best appetite lately.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.830
I've lost some weight.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.630
I don't think these earrings
are a good fit for me.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.680
You know?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.510
But Market Lord, why do I feel like

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.560
your face has become more rounded?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.520
Don't you agree?

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.270
Who said so?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.710
Isn't that the case?

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.560
Why would you grow rounder
if you didn't have an appetite?

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.200
A face as round as a silver plate

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.240
will serve to
demonstrate one's prosperity.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.680
Shut up if you don't know what to say.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.240
I don't like them! I'm not taking them!

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.190
It was just a joke.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.560
Why are you so petty?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.830
Of course I understood
what you meant, Market Lord.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.810
I already prepared
something else in advance.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.960
Su Beilu.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.030
Coming.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.360
I just happened to bring four cups.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.510
One for each of us.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.560
Aren't you...

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.480
What are you doing here?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.910
Chu Qiu,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.720
is anyone allowed
to enter Luoxia Manor now?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.120
Not if they're empty-handed.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.650
That's right.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.510
I came here to bring you
some boba milk tea.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.970
It's a popular beverage in our era.
They sell this everywhere.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.920
And, this shop sells the best boba.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.030
Hurry and try it.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.590
You think you can brush me off
with such an ordinary beverage?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.040
I'll take it if you don't want it.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.470
Since you've gone through
all the effort to bring this here,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.360
I... I suppose I can give it a try.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.440
Wait.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.120
I have to test any food
that's brought here

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.040
for poison before
Market Lord tries them.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.880
How is it?

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.320
Wait a little longer.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.240
Are you done?

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.430
The onset of toxin takes time.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.830
Just tell us directly if you want one.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.190
Don't leave Market Lord hanging.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.870
Just drink it. I wouldn't poison you.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.750
Precisely.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.000
It's so delicious.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.510
This is called
Glutinous Bubble Milk Foam

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.040
Popping Tea with Sesame,
Berry, Mango, and Peach.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.990
Can you actually
repeat the name perfectly

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.390
if you were to say it again?

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.390
Glutinous Bubble Milk Foam Popping Tea
with Sesame, Berry, Mango, and Peach.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.910
Glutinous...

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.960
Popping...

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:39.200
I can't remember the name.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.670
It's delicious. Let's have a toast.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.760
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.200
Market Lord, since you've enjoyed
the delicious drink we brought,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.040
if so,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.120
about the item we desire...

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.120
I almost forgot about it.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.270
Thank you, Market Lord.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.840
Repeat the name.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.720
Mermaid Candle? Chan?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.030
Mister,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.750
please spare us some food.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.600
Mister,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.480
- please spare us some food.
- Please spare us some food.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.320
We're here to distribute rations.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.080
(Ration)

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.360
We're here to distribute rations.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.260
Gather around.
We're here to distribute rations.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.840
Don't fight.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.690
Do not cause any commotion.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.500
Be quiet. Go and line up.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.000
Sir, please give me some!

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.670
Stop stealing it!

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.510
Scram!

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.230
How dare you steal?

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.350
You deserve this!

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.710
Go and line up!

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:00.790
Next.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.630
Line up!

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.320
Line up!

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.370
My grain!

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.360
My grain!

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.620
- That's enough. Next.
- Of the 3,000 bushels of state grain,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.240
now that they've arrived here,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.870
is there even 30 left?

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.550
Though 10,000 palaces

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.720
now lie in dust,

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.030
how much gold

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.240
was taken by greed?

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.840
And how much famine grain

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.550
was consumed by corruption?

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.440
What a sin.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.440
What a sin...

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.380
Stop stealing.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.390
Line up.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.120
Stop stealing!

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.200
Go and line up!

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.270
(Ration)

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.110
Scram!

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.080
It seems I'm still one step too late.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.840
(In a chaotic world such as this,)

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.200
(if this tiny candle
can serve its purpose,)

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.470
(I suppose it counts as
a virtuous deed as well.)

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.870
(Forget it.)

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.080
(When the time comes,)

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.510
(I'm sure we'll meet again.)

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.460
(Chan)

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.100
How come it's still the same size
even after burning all night?

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.870
This is great.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.670
I can use this candle again tonight.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.990
We're here to distribute rations.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.470
We're here to distribute rations.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.320
No stealing allowed.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.960
All of you are like mad dogs.
Stop stealing.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.800
Don't be impatient.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.650
Go and line up.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.160
Stop stealing!

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.630
Stop stealing!

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.320
Stop squeezing!

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.170
Please give me some!

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.510
Go and line up!

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.790
Stop squeezing!

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.080
Here. Just leave already.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.570
Go and line up at the back.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:06.960
Give it to me!

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.680
Who are you?

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.880
I'm the Mermaid of Dongting.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.310
A mermaid?

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.200
Young girl,

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.030
why were you crying

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.030
just now?

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.310
I went out to get some rations.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.110
I lost

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.350
my only flatbread.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.640
A bad guy snatched it from me.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.030
And, he broke my basket as well.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.240
Eat up.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.880
Is that a flatbread?

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.590
Thank you.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.840
Sit down.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.790
There's no rush.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.920
Take your time.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.950
Have some water.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.680
Chan, there's no rush.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.150
Drink it slowly.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.550
How did you know that my name was Chan?

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.160
I'm the millennium mermaid
of Lake Dongting, you know?

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.550
I know everything about the world.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.070
If so, I have a question for you.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.480
Ask away.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.440
Miss Mermaid,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:53.970
please tell me.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.680
How can I continue
to survive in this world?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.510
You're so young,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.790
yet you're asking me
such a deep question.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.310
Chan,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.350
listen.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.040
Life

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.790
is all about the food we have.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.680
Chan,

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.640
you'll understand it naturally

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.640
once you grow up.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.320
Eat up.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.830
Miss Mermaid,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.790
you're so nice to me.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.000
Chan, it's because

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.920
you released me from the candle.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.110
From now on,

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.510
I'll always keep you company

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.070
as long as the candle flame is there.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.240
Eat up.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.190
Are you cold?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.590
I am.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.070
Your clothing is so thin.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.110
Aren't you cold?

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.430
Wow.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.310
Your body is so warm.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.590
Can I sleep next to you?

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.920
Miss Mermaid,

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.400
what's your name?

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.310
My name, huh?

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.070
My name is whatever

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.160
you wish to call me.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.430
What about Nuan?

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.920
What do you think?

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.510
It's because you're so warm.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.070
Nuan, huh?

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.680
Nuan?

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.270
Nuan.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.040
Nuan,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.400
it turns out
that you can fix baskets, huh?

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.680
There are even pears inside.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.750
This is great!

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.510
It's been so long since I had pears.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.880
Nuan,

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.240
how did you create them?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.160
It's a piece of cake for me.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.240
I've never tried a pear
this sweet before!

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.350
Thank you, Nuan.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.830
Nuan, you're so mystical.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:27.640
Nuan,

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.400
your outfit looks so pretty.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.950
Do you like it?

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.680
I do.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.520
Put it on, then.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.310
Yan's outfit is so difficult to wash.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.400
Luckily, we washed it clean yesterday.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.960
She treasures this outfit very much.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.980
I'm sure she'll be happy
when she receives it.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.960
Last night, we worked so hard

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.270
to make all those scented sachets.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.500
There will be plenty
of customers in the house today.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.400
I hope we can sell more of them.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.720
But the floor manager
is annoying, though.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.880
He'd better pray
that he doesn't encounter me today.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.310
If I do encounter him again,

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.110
I'll surely tell him off.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.080
Nuan.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.000
It's been so many years, you know?

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.750
How come you're still the same?

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.880
You're indeed the Mermaid of Dongting.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.880
You never age.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.030
If only I could be as beautiful as you.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.870
No.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.890
One-third. Just having
your one-third is enough.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.680
I'll stop here. I need
to make some money.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.450
Making a living is
the most important thing.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.200
This looks pretty.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.060
Try one.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.940
How much?

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.200
It's cheap. Just 100 wen.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.030
- Does it look good?
- Yeah. It looks great on you.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:39.920
I'll take this, then.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.920
Please come again.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.960
Miss.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.310
Please check out our hairpins.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.920
Check out this
Red Jade Plum Blossom Hairpin.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.200
It's perfect for you.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.960
Come on. It's okay
even if you're not buying anything.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.530
It doesn't cost anything to try them on.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.510
Let me put it on for you.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.920
It suits you perfectly.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.110
It looks great on you.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.960
How much for this hairpin?

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.160
50 wen.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.880
It's fine. Thank you.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.070
But Miss, you look great
with that hairpin.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.350
I'm telling the truth.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.920
Where exactly is the Mermaid Candle?

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.630
We've arrived.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.880
Zuichun House?

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.000
Is it a restaurant?

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:34.110
Not entirely.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.720
Mister, come on.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.680
Yeah, mister.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.790
I'll serve you well tonight.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.070
Don't tell me it's the kind of house
I'm imagining.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.590
I think so.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.790
- Just look at us.
- Come on.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.750
This won't do.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.350
I'm considered
a promising young talent, you know?

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.590
I mustn't visit such a place.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.580
Since we're already here,
we should make the best of it.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.270
Hey, this place doesn't
suit our status at all.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.400
(Zuichun House)
We're already here, you know?

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.720
Misters!

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.830
Don't touch him!

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.350
- He'll pay tonight.
- Don't come near!

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.510
Don't touch me either!

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.830
Don't be shy.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.240
Come on.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.550
Scented sachet for sale.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.440
10 wen each.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.350
Just 10 wen each.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.590
Plum blossom, gardenia,
and jasmine-scented sachets.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.680
We sell all kinds of scents.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.200
Don't miss out on them!

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.480
Stop harassing our customers!

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.070
Your customers can buy
my scented sachets for the girls.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.030
That'll make them happy.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.790
It's something that both parties desire.
How am I harassing them?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.980
I'm helping out with
Zuichun House's business too.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.550
Lass, you got quite
the sharp tongue, don't you?

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.310
Although you're the local laundress,

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.750
no one said
that you could sell your trinkets here.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.710
Hurry to the backyard
and bring in the laundry.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.790
If not, I'll report you
to our superiors.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.000
By then, you'll lose your job!

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.720
Can't you see
that I'm here to deliver the laundry?

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.560
Stop rushing me!

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:41.410
Just go already.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.790
He's so detestable.
Business is already terrible today.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.740
I didn't sell a single scented sachet.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.790
And, that stupid floor manager
just chased me away.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.720
You've finally arrived.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.920
Hurry and bring in the laundry.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.350
By the way, these are Yan's outfits.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.450
Please deliver them to her.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.950
Yan?

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480
You didn't know?

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:02.790
She ran away.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.960
She ran away?

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.680
It happened this morning.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.030
Yan didn't wake up.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.070
My sister went to find her.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.370
Only then did she realize
that the room was already empty.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.590
Everyone said

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.200
that she eloped with a man.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.070
How could that be?

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.000
Yan treasures this outfit the most.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.830
Why would she run away
without telling us?

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.720
Just take the outfit. I'll take it as if
this encounter never took place.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.200
I still have a lot of laundry to do.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.270
I'll resume my work first.

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.830
Sir, watch out!

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:43.680
Are you okay?

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.400
Go and call for help.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:56.390
What are you doing?

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.030
Young girl,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.110
you're pretty cute.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.340
- Let me have some fun...
- What are you doing?

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:04.430
What am I doing?

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.240
To think that they're hiding
such a cute girl like you.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.920
I'm not one of them.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.590
I'm just a worker.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:12.790
You're a worker, huh?

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.310
Does that explain why
I cannot have fun with you?

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920
Don't come near me!

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.760
I'm coming!

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.620
- Don't come near me!
- Sir!

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.990
So what if you're an official?
I'll report you to the yamen!

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.300
Hey, how dare you
speak to Sir like that?

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.750
Sir, she's just a worker.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.110
She's not good enough for you.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.800
Let's head inside.
There are better girls.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.000
Let's go.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.880
Let's go.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.510
She said she wanted
to report me to the yamen!

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:35.910
She doesn't dare to do so.
If she dares, I'll break her legs.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:37.310
Please don't let her get to you.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.790
We shall drink with you.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:39.630
Let's go.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:50.720
Can you still drink?

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.760
Let's drink a little more.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.110
- Come on.
- No.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.000
Again.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.440
I'm drinking too much.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.280
One more sip.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.550
One more sip.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.120
Drink up.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.750
- One more sip.
- One more sip.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.550
One more cup.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.440
Come on, drink up.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.510
One more round!

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:07.790
Okay!

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.590
Two little bees,

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.270
flying into the trees.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.270
Flying left and right...

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.550
You guys lost!

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.200
All of you have to drink!

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.270
- Let's drink.
- Ladies, make him drink.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.520
Miss,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.750
all of them lost.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.480
Bring me the lady I desire!

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:29.680
Okay.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.420
I will.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.740
(Zuichun House)

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.110
Ladies, all of you may leave.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.680
You should have some water to sober up.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.440
Misters, you two
have excellent taste indeed.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.440
Chan is our top performer here.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.720
Greetings, misters.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.030
What do you two

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.270
wish to do today?

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.040
That's not it.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:02.440
Please don't misunderstand us.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.790
We're here to inquire about something.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.880
Have you ever heard of
the Mermaid Candle?

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.590
What is that?

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.310
It's a blue candle
that can last forever.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.350
It's very precious to me.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.510
Mister,

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.310
are you kidding me?

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.110
How can a candle

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.830
last forever?

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.960
Please try to recall every detail.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.880
I'm begging you here.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.790
I drank so much just now.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.000
I didn't lie to you

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.510
or keep anything from you.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.240
Mister,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.960
if you don't trust me,

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.790
you can search my body.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.590
You can search

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.790
- every inch of my body.
- Don't.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.440
Is she the only person named Chan here?

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.880
Indeed.

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.350
Wait.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.440
Who's Chan?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.160
I'm Chang'e.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.310
You're Chang'e?

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.440
We're looking for Chan.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.830
This is Chang'e,
the person you were looking for,

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.200
not Chan.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.270
Isn't your accent too thick?

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.110
We were looking for Chan.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.310
Can it be

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.720
that you guys are looking for

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.400
that Chan?

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.000
Which Chan?

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.480
Chan

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.440
isn't one of the courtesans here.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.110
She's just a worker
who does our laundry.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.150
Where is she?

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.000
She was here to pick up
the dirty laundry just now.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.680
But she has already left.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.590
Why don't you two come over tomorrow?

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.070
I'm not coming tomorrow.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.000
Tomorrow...

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.830
Mister, don't leave me.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.090
Report me to the local authority, huh?

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.110
I'm the local authority.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:12.670
Come.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.790
- Come into my arms!
- Don't come near me!

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.920
Help!

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.550
How dare you bite me?

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.110
Help!

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.400
Come here!

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.240
Help!

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.350
Come here!

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.640
Who are you?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.030
That's Mr. Jiang Ling.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.480
Who?

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.200
Mr. Jiang Ling.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.790
Mr. Jiang Ling?

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.240
I...

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200
I was drunk just now.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.490
Please pardon me for my rudeness.

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:53.480
Scram.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.080
Miss.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.760
Are you okay?

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.960
Mr. Jiang Ling,
thank you for rescuing me.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.950
You're walking alone
in the middle of the night.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.590
Do you need me to send you home?

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.080
It's okay.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.190
I live nearby.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:21.510
Farewell.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.670
Chan.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:44.510
Nuan?

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.400
What are you doing here?

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.440
I was worried about you.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.360
How could you not come home this late?

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.330
Don't you know that it's dangerous
for you to be out there until this hour?

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.000
I did come home late tonight.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.350
Just now, I...

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.030
- I...
- Let's go home.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.910
Chan,

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.390
come here.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.760
Look closely.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.760
This is a person's vital spot.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.840
Remember this.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.000
If anyone dares to hurt you,

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.360
you must repay the favor.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.280
Here.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.550
What are you doing?

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.390
What's wrong?

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.510
Are you scared?

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.800
Remember this.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.230
If you wish to survive
in this chaotic world,

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:10.360
you have to learn
how to protect yourself.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.520
Relying on yourself
is better than relying on others.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.960
When you face villains,

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.190
if you don't dare to act,

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.070
you'll be the only one

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.030
who will be hurt.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.840
I hope

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.550
never to see the day

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.000
when you never return home again.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.460
Understood.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.140
Many years ago,

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:43.700
you once asked me

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.340
how you should survive in this world.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.820
In a world like this,

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.500
those who are soft-hearted

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.820
cannot survive.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.180
Life is

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.300
a matter between good and evil.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.980
What happened to him?

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.940
This is terrible.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.980
It's a murder.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.380
Strange things
have been happening lately.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:28.860
First, a young girl went missing.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.100
And now, there's a murder.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.500
I heard that this man
used to harass women.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.060
He received his just deserts.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:42.860
You should stop.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.420
Make way!

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.860
Things haven't been too peaceful lately.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.880
We have to be more careful
when we leave the house.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.060
Who actually has he offended?

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.020
That was ruthless.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.380
Let's go.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.060
Mister, I want this.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.580
- Wrap it for me.
- All right.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.250
Miss, do you want
to check out our kites?

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.820
Freshly brewed liquor for sale.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:22.820
Do you want one?

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.660
Next time.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.300
Miss.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.540
(Zuichun House)

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.380
Miss.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:31.820
Mr. Jiang Ling?

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.580
I didn't expect

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.900
to see you again today.

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.700
I suppose we're destined to meet.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.140
You look pale.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.500
Are you sick?

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.180
That's not it.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.860
I'm glad to hear that.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.740
Next time, you must be careful
when you walk alone at night.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.500
I heard that they found someone dead
by the lakeside last night.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.460
And, it was an official.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.740
Is that so?

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.320
Next time, when you walk alone at night,
you can tell me about it.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.420
My guard can escort you home.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.260
Thank you, Mr. Jiang Ling.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.100
Farewell.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.180
Wait.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.300
Mr. Jiang Ling,
I haven't repaid your favor yet.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.720
Although these scented sachets
are nothing precious,

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.020
please take some of them.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.340
Mr. Jiang Ling, I'm sure
you're used to exquisite wares.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.940
My needlework is rather clumsy.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.420
I hope you don't mind.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.220
"A red ribbon
and a brocade scented sachet,

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.820
given to show my affection to you,

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.460
dear young sir".

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.540
I heard that one buys scented sachets
for the people they fancy.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.620
Your needlework is exquisite.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.500
And, the scent is unique.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.860
What kind of scent is this?

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.400
I made this scent from
the flowers growing in my backyard.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.340
They're merely cheap wildflowers.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.060
There's only one person in my heart.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.420
Therefore, I only need
one scented sachet.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.620
Here you go.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.260
Mister, you don't have to.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.380
It's a gift from me.

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:16.660
Just take it.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.940
Thank you, Mr. Jiang Ling.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.180
By the way, I haven't had the pleasure
of learning your name yet.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.340
I'm Chan.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.460
Chan?

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.140
Chan.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.380
Tomorrow night, there will be
a poetry gathering by Lake Dongting.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.220
I'm the organizer.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.060
Chan, I hope you can make it.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.700
When you're there,
just show them this scented sachet.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.180
They'll allow you to go upstairs.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.580
I shall make a move first.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:57.860
