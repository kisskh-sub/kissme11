00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.760
Do you know who I am?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.000
I want you to keep walking forward

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.760
in your new life.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.280
I don't want to be the one

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.400
who makes you look back.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.840
You're still as hypocritical

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.760
as when you were a kid.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.790
Why?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.740
Why didn't you just keep pretending?

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.350
"Hypocritical" is your word.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.640
I'm protecting myself.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.680
I'm reminding myself:

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.070
Once I forget my parents

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.710
and the life I had,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.640
I'll never be able to return.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.560
Do I remind you

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.150
of the time

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.560
you were abducted?

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.590
Are you dodging

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.150
that shameful past?

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.710
I admit it.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.310
I thought I'd forget

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.150
and throw the pain away.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.840
But it's still here.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.910
It never left.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.190
Does it hurt you?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.280
I've never been

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.590
the person you wanted.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.150
I looked after you,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.400
became a cop,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.280
tried to fix other people's crises

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.630
because

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.030
I was powerless

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.400
against my own.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.960
Lu Ran,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.000
have you ever killed someone?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.750
Lu Ran?

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.540
(Grand Opening)

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.420
Longyuan Group

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.520
has always upheld

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.590
the principle

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.000
of benefiting society.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.530
Through its charity program,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.800
it donated 200,000 yuan worth

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.080
of new uniforms, computers,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.590
and school supplies to the 74 pupils

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.910
of Liangbu Primary School

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.030
in Lushi Town.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.910
We hope every child

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.360
will grow up grateful

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.600
and one day repay their hometown

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.190
and society.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.160
Thank you, everyone.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.000
Captain He, the signal jammer

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.870
has been installed.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.950
We can move any time.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.230
Okay.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.430
Huiyue Commercial Center

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.070
is officially open.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.160
I know.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.720
I still have some paperwork unfinished.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.370
Once the goods reach abroad,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.800
they need to be cashed out fast.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.510
Find me a channel.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.430
How is this a threat?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.000
Ms. Liang,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.430
we're friends.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.270
You...

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.390
Please help me out.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.820
(See you at the old place
at 10 tonight.)

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.040
30 million for real?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.120
Xu Yi's original target

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.160
was 30 million.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.040
What did he actually get?

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.670
3 million.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.630
I really regret

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.630
not installing a camera in there

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.510
to see Hou Liangyuan's face now.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.600
Why did you help Zhao Xin?

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.430
Because she was pitiful.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.240
Did you help Liu Wanyao

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.430
also because she was pitiful?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.680
Liu Wanyao isn't dead.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.160
Do you remember the old days?

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.830
You taught me so much.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.220
(Perfect crime)

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.980
(Unrelated, officially non-existent)

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.960
(Step into one's blind spot,
exploit their mind)

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.190
Create an alibi.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.800
(Invisible in the case)
Form

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.420
(The impossible culprit)
a shared empathy

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.480
with others.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.840
Yuan,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.040
do you believe

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.160
a perfect crime is possible?

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.390
How dare he mess with me?

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.040
Bring me my new ID papers.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.720
The ledger, too.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.310
Meet me in the tunnel later.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.440
Got it.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.040
During the ribbon-cutting,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.560
Mrs. Li told me

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.430
a foreign businessman

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.950
is hosting a private banquet tomorrow

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.190
up on East Hill.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.430
He is

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.160
an art investor

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.310
from Country S,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.520
an overseas Chinese,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.510
back to visit relatives

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.510
and scout

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.270
for promising partnerships.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:38.030
Lots of art dealers will be there.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.600
We have to go.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.360
We've got experience

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.480
in art trading.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.000
A clear edge.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.840
Exactly.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.630
Shall I pick you

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.790
a nice gift?

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.270
Cost doesn't matter.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.790
I've neglected you lately

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.000
because of Hou Liangyuan.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.240
Your birthday's coming up.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.670
I'll make it up to you.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.200
You actually remembered.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.230
It's okay.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.200
As long as I stay by your side,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.910
I'm content.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.480
I'm the one who can't leave you.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.150
Oh, stop it.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:33.660
(SWAT)

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.580
(Danger; Do not approach)

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.180
(Danger; Do not approach)

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.980
(In the target area)

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.440
Come out.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:53.710
Come out!

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.590
Don't kill me.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.260
I'm not one of them.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.860
- Stay back!
- Talk slowly; calm down.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.730
I'm a cop.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.670
I was abducted, too.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.270
I'm one of the girls they took.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.420
Hou Liangyuan and his gang
split up and ran.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.060
The greenhouse.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.220
The greenhouse is full

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.030
of girls like me.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.080
They're tied up.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.630
I'll take you; come on!

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.790
We have to hurry!

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.960
Suspect fleeing toward the road.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.800
Team 2, assist.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.510
Roger.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.550
Afraid the cops will arrest me?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.910
Hand me the USB drive.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:49.850
What will happen after?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.600
Live by the law.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.080
You betrayed

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.270
the rules of our game.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.390
I should've known

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.750
you'd never

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.030
give up your choice so easily.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.080
The cops came at the right time.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.550
It seems

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.550
that Hou Liangyuan

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.000
never got a surprise.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.480
He got a death warrant.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.840
Give me the USB drive.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.420
It's your chance at a lighter sentence.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.840
Did you ever give me a chance?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.960
In all my life,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.670
have you ever chosen me?

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.870
Then why am I even here?

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.270
You've crossed the line.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.790
You only want evidence.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.790
I'm not as stupid as Hou Liangyuan.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.720
Tell me what I have to do

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.080
to make you turn back.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.960
Take off my uniform

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.360
and drop my name like you?

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.630
Is that the result you want?

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.240
That's right.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.710
Lu Ran,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.440
grow up and think.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.710
Yuan.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.440
You still have hope.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.340
Let's go now.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.780
(Zhen Yuandao)

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:27.750
Where's the ledger?

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.200
I panicked and forgot it.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.280
I'll run back.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.130
You head down first.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.150
Cops are everywhere.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.080
Be careful.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.920
Don't worry.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.780
I won't drag you down.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.630
Good brother.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.800
Yin Wei,

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.800
where are you?

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.000
Near the dock.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.940
We just arrested a few.

Lots of girls are trapped here.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.630
Hurry.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.790
Are you here to save us?

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.910
We'll get you out.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.910
You have to get us out!

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.320
Guo Zhixin?

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.960
Guo Zhixin!

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.680
Hou,

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.200
sorry.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.560

Come closer, and I'll kill you.

Zhuang Mingcheng.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.830
How did you get in?

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.310
I crawled back from hell

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.680
to collect your soul.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.400
I never thought

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.320
I'd get to walk

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880
your last mile

with you.

What do you want?

We can cut a deal.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.480
Looks like Mr. Jiang

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.000
really forgot me.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.480
In Lujia Village back then,

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:56.590
I was your masterpiece

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.200
in human sales.

Name your price.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.830
I can afford anything.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.030
You can't.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.880
I only sold a few people.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.790
I'll do the time.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.790
I've got evidence on Mai Boyuan.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.680
He was a part of this.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.920
I'll tell the cops everything.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.240
I am

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.720
starting

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.920
to like you.

We can talk.

Right now,

(on the chessboard.)

Where's He Ya?

Xu,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.390
are you okay?

Where's He Ya?

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.590
Mr. Xu, are you okay?

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.680
She took some injured girls

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.520
to the hospital.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.550
Any sign of Hou Liangyuan?

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.080
No. The signal was cut out.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.590
Where is the last location?

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.000
Near the resort lobby.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.840
That way.

A girl says there's a tunnel

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.510
- in the greenhouse.
- Liu Ming.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.350
The resort tunnel

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.190
is in the greenhouse.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.040
You two, head back.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.000
I'll be fine.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.560
Liu Ming.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.910
Mr. Xu.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.240
Mr. Xu?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.240
Liu Ming!

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.800
Take this

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.510
to Captain He.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.150
Give it to her,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.350
not anyone else.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.270
What about you?

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.110
Go!

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.550
All this fuss for a suburb.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.640
Why?

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.510
Routine check. Please cooperate.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.400
Sure, sure.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.240
Thanks.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.180
Where did you come from?

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.320
Just over there.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.070
Pop the trunk, please.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.400
Hello, spot check.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.950
Licenses of the driver and the vehicle.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.160
What's going on?

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.000
Let's go.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.350
Keep away from him.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640
Don't go that way.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.790
Should we call 120?

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:33.630
Sure.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:35.310
Who is that?

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.250
Such a serious injury.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.800
Help...

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.880
Help me.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.410
He's covered in blood.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.350
Help me.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.750
Everyone, move back.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.920
Step back.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:51.930
Step back.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.310
Stop filming.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:55.480
Step back; stop filming.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.240
Phones down. Step back.

(Emergency)

(Where are you?)

(Are you back?)

(I just left the hospital,)

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:38.390
(heading back now.)

(Interview Room)

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.190
Liu,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.010
I'm here for the report.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.590
Yin Wei.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.620
Director Feng.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.620
Have you seen Xu Jingzhi?

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:26.960
He didn't come back with you?

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.440
He said the job isn't done,

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.450
and he knows how to get
the USB drive back.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.430
Mr. Xu,

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.320
I forgot to tell you

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.160
that I moved again.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.830
I've given the ledger to the police.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.190
What?

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.550
Are you calling me

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.590
because you miss me?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.920
You know exactly why I called.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Sorry.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.200
I'm not turning myself in.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.840
By the way,

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.440
I forgot to tell you

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:28.700
that Captain He won't have dinner

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:29.940
with you tonight.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.030
How about a little reunion

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.070
with us instead?

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.480
Tomorrow, 5 p.m.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.240
Deal?

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.480
Come alone.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.800
If you don't,

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.680
you'll never

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.880
see her again.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.280
Fine.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.830
What about the identity

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.000
and assets you promised?

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.510
You're more capable and ruthless

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.440
than Mai Boyuan.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.790
Why not come

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.760
and work for me?

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.920
Someone like me

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.070
doesn't belong beside you.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.550
I just want what's fair

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.590
for years of sweat.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.110
Time to live the life I want.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.550
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:06.150
Okay.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.240
If you ever

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.080
change your mind,

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.160
my door

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.310
is always open.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.960
Wuyang's getting better.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:17.830
There are more chances than out there.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.960
I'm a lone wolf now.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.000
There's nothing left to miss.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.760
Mr. Gao,

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.400
though you've got the USB drive,

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.880
Mai Boyuan might still hold

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.110
other cards against you.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.830
Better safe than sorry.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.080
Tomorrow,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.260
he'll be at the auction

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.450
held by the foreign investor.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:44.830
Maybe you two

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.400
should have an honest talk.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.270
I'll think about it.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.300
(Liang Xinyue)

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.030
Drive extra slowly on the road.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.920
If anything happens,
you can't afford it.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.950
Yes, Ms. Liang.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.220
(Wuyang Police)

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.070
Director Feng, He Ya's been abducted.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:21.440
(Wuyang Police)
He Ya was last seen

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.800
near Wuyang Hospital.

Team 2 and 4, support Team 1.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.800
Conduct a radiating search.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.640
Yes.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.580
The ledger Liu Ming brought back

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.960
must log every deal

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.360
between Mai Boyuan

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.300
and the other investors.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.440
Trace every amount

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.360
and every shipment.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.200
Understood.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.120
Director Feng.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.830
- Are you okay?
