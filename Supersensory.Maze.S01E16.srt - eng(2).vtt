00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.790
Captain He,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.330
the other group

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.470
of rescued victims are here,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.760
ready for an interview anytime.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.040
(Interview room)

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.200
I don't remember.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.070
Once the car started moving,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.310
I smelled something

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560
like wood.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Dogs barking, chickens clucking.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.560
It must've been a village.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.120
They deserve to die!

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.120
He's not even human.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.760
Officer.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.480
He kept saying I was

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.840
his runaway daughter,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.640
and he was taking me home.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.560
I begged passers-by for help.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.790
No one believed me.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.510
He said he was lost

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.120
and asked me to lead the way.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.730
So,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.240
I got into his car.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.430
They'd paw us,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.590
but that man stopped

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.680
anything else,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.560
saying we'd be

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.270
worth less

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.630
if we were touched.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.150
I was 17,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.800
on my way to register at college,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.430
when Hou Liangyuan abducted me.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.710
After some time,

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.120
he gave me to Mai Boyuan.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.840
What's your name?

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.520
It must be a misunderstanding.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.030
Tell me.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.560
Let's sort it out.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.560
Grudges can always be fixed,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.400
right?

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.800
Is it Xu Yi?

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.240
He didn't know what not to do.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.590
I told him

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.400
some lines he couldn't cross,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.560
but he wouldn't listen.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.240
It's my fault.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.520
What do you want?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.520
Tell me.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.280
I'll give you anything.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.750
We had a simple

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.800
business arrangement.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.310
He asked me to source

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.240
contemporary art for export sales.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.300
(Art Auctions)
These transaction sums

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.540
are far above the market price
for comparable pieces.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.590
How do you explain that?

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.910
He's a businessman.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.870
A businessman

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.680
creates value

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.840
where others don't see it.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.470
He's good at that.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.360
I think that is normal.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.430
You consider this normal?

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.870
Art

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.630
carries extra value.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.630
Commercially speaking,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.750
it's standard practice.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.430
Where did all this come from?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.560
(Longyuan Group Sex-Trafficking Case)

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.560
Gifts from Mai Boyuan.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.630
He'd hand me money from time to time,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.560
luxury goods,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.750
and even cars and apartments.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.720
What have you done for Mai Boyuan?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.270
You've found out, right?

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.950
Look at these girls' photos.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.950
Every file
about their disappearance carries

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.280
(Project-funding file)
your signature.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.310
I only wanted to stay alive.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.270
Compared with what they did to me,

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.680
I was gentle with those girls.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.310
I never meant to hurt them.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.900
Let me go.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.040
I'll have money wired to you.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.880
How about that?

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.190
You were with Mai Boyuan

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.040
for years.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.360
Do you know what he

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.500
and Hou Liangyuan were doing?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.950
Is this for a sentence reduction?

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.710
It depends on how much you tell us.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.630
He valued my connections

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.560
and admired my abilities.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.270
At that time,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.240
he began buying art in bulk

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.480
and had me move it overseas.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.800
The assets

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.600
should be almost fully transferred.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.310
I was a gift from Hou Liangyuan

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.480
to Mai Boyuan

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.720
while he was building

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.480
the commercial street and the factories.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.360
On the surface,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.200
Hou Liangyuan was

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.360
supplying earthwork and materials;

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.600
in truth, he kept trafficking women.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.070
He kept a lot of thugs on payroll.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.040
He once told me

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.830
to come back to him

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.000
after I'd built a tie

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.430
with Mai Boyuan.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.160
I didn't want to,

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.920
so I begged Mai Boyuan

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.390
to let me stay.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.750
Neither place was good,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.070
but at least I wouldn't be

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.310
passed around anymore.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.440
Later...

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.110
You already know

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.430
the dirty work later.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.270
Apart from selling artworks for him,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.120
did you two have any other business?

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.390
No.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.270
Mai Boyuan's smart.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.830
His business is doing great.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.240
Hou Liangyuan's a nothing.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.160
All he thinks about is

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.190
who gets the next girl.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.920
When that stopped working,

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.560
he switched to filming videos

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.310
and blackmailing people for leverage.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.950
What's Xu Yi's relationship

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.030
with them?

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.830
That's a total jerk.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.430
Mai Boyuan brought him in

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.480
to replace Hou Liangyuan,

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.270
but Hou and Xu

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.360
hit it off

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.000
and teamed up instead.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.240
If Mai ever escapes,

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.830
his first job will be

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.800
to erase both of them.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.750
Can't you tell me what you want?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.160
You're crazy.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.480
Let go of me!

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.120
What do you want?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.000
You...

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.430
Who sent you?

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.270
Was Mai Boyuan planning

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.240
to take you with him?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.910
Next month,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.000
I might take some days off.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.880
Son,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.390
anywhere you wanna go?

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.600
I'll take you.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.360
The bear you gave me

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.790
is always with me.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:41.960
Do you see it?

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.840
He went

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.120
through all this trouble

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:36.910
just to target you.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.360
What's he trying to get

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.320
from you?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.120
Some people stay chained

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.440
to one past moment,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.680
one person,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.240
craving approval and acceptance.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.120
You're that person.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.300
(Tomb of Wu Min, a Loving Mother)

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.820
(Tomb of Lu Ran)

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.320
Talk.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.550
Tell me everything you've done.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.120
Do you hear me?

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.360
Talk,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.510
and I'll set you free.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.000
I started by selling people.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.000
Kids first.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.480
Then girls

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.550
for prostitution and videos.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.870
I used the tapes to extort.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.990
Director Feng.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.270
Come for a meeting now.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.150
Liu Wanyao kidnapped Mai Boyuan.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.150
I got a taste for it.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.600
To win the contracts

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.600
for the commercial street

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.150
and the factories,

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.750
I...

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.840
I handed girls over

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.600
as gifts.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.550
The disobedient ones were disposed of.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.390
Later, I moved into finance

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.630
and met

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.000
bigger fish.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.630
Sex bribes

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.120
were too slow,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.870
so I used Liang Xinyue

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.390
in artwork export

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.670
to launder money.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.440
Then I met

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.630
her husband Xu Yi

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.910
and opened a clubhouse for him

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.960
to cook my books.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.750
But he and Hou Liangyuan

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.840
used the clubhouse to traffic girls.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.720
Later, I thought of Liang Xinyue's

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.870
nursing school.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.600
Those girls

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.200
could be used for prostitution.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:15.320
She forced me to say those things.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.200
Police!

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.910
Help me, police!

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.440
Get me out of here!

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.360
The extracted audio waveform

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.910
shows reverb.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.750
In the audio,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.360
two identical patterns appear,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.030
repeating 0.07 s later.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.910
It repeated

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.360
with a decrease

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.720
0.08 s later.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.510
Mai Boyuan is likely inside

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.870
an enclosed space.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.960
Glints

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.900
in the video background

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.670
point to a shipping container.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.240
If so,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.510
it probably is

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.720
a 30-chi cargo container.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.390
We pulled records

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.320
from every freight

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.840
and logistics firm in Wuyang.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.390
No containers were reported lost

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.630
or damaged.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.750
But abandoned containers

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.320
can't be ruled out.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.440
Based on the info

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.540
provided by the tech dept.,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.390
in this 8-minute live video,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.600
there were two occurrences

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.960
of external HF sound waves

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.010
with vibration frequency matching

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.450
that of an industrial electric drill.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:04.550
We're assuming

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.510
a construction site

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.000
near the container.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.080
Cross-reference

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.630
active building sites

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.000
with the known locations

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.600
of containers asap.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.440
Keep me

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.630
updated.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.670
The cops will come to save you, right?

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.600
Your hands are soaked in blood.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.750
If someone saves you,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.440
what about me?

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.080
Who's coming for me?

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.440
Who?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.200
You're a girl

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.840
from the clubhouse,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.720
right?

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.030
What did I do?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.270
Why won't you let me go?

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.270
I'll give you anything

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.790
you want.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.480
Don't do something stupid.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.670
Xinxin and I had planned

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.440
that after we graduated,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.790
we'd pass the hospital exam

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.080
and go traveling.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.960
But before I could graduate,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.670
I was tricked into Jinmengwan.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.750
Principal Xu.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.270
Liu Wanyao,

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.140
I've got great news.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.840
I've found a hospital
that will take you.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.440
I'm driving you there today.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.870
Thank you. That's great.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.350
- Hop in.
- Sure.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.750
This is a caregiver from the hospital,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.930
a future colleague of yours.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:06.870
He's coming along.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.920
Sure. Hi, everyone.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.030
Hi. Mind your head.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.160
A toast to Mr. Liang.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.030
Come on, Mr. Liang.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.440
Cheers.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.720
- Have fun.
- Have fun.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.760
Mr. Hu.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.000
She's here.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.310
Come here.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.160
Have a seat.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.920
Why are you here?

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.200
Come here.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.280
Go.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:00.030
Sorry, Mr. Yao.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:00.870
Sorry.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.910
She's not the one.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.550
I'll get you another one.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.720
My apologies.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.070
Liu Wanyao,

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:14.790
you know

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.160
what I do now.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.310
You're just as filthy.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.080
Listen.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.200
Keep your mouth shut.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.550
If you keep Wu Xinxin in the dark,

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.400
I can send you to a decent man.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.520
But

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.750
if you tell her,

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.070
I'll send both of you

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.750
to a man

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.030
to keep him company.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.110
How dare you mention Wu Xinxin!

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.960
Let go!

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:40.000
You jerk!

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.720
Sorry, Mr. Hu! Sorry!

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.560
Watch your tongue.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.960
I won't let you off.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.880
You jerk!

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.880
It took me a year to escape.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.320
Guess

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.830
who I saw inside?

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:11.590
Yeah.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.510
My life is garbage.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.720
Even my mom wishes

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720
I were dead.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.480
I can live with that.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.680
But Xinxin died.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.000
Hu Bo...

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.440
Why do we have to bear

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.400
the consequences

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.310
of your actions?

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.550
Why?

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.750
Everything behind this

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.680
is tied to you,

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.830
so none of you

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.110
can get away.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.240
It's all because of you.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.030
It's all because of you.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.270
It's all because of you.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.270
Do you understand?

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.660
(Police)

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.980
(SWAT)

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.590
I heard

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.270
that a person

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.640
can last ten days

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:29.590
on water alone.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.950
Hello?

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.080
No one here.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.640
I've checked nearby areas.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.350
No recent signs of activity.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.750
Whoever took Mai Boyuan

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.960
is misleading us.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.200
Keep hunting that suspicious boat.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.960
Check this again.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.950
Captain He.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.480
Mr. Xu.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.110
Liang Xinyue and Zhao Xin

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.460
are almost through interrogation.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.640
Every station

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.760
and auxiliary unit

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.310
is out searching for Mai Boyuan.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.750
Still nothing. We're waiting for news.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.160
I'm dead on my feet.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.400
Mr. Xu, your nose is bleeding.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.240
Let me, let me.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.880
Raise your head.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:46.790
Got the little gadget?

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.790
Sort out the files on Zhuang Mingcheng

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:57.920
and Mai Boyuan first.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.170
We can't keep doing this.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.030
It's been 48 hours.
No one can handle that.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.400
Let's split into two teams.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.750
Liu Ming, go home and sleep.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.270
Xu Jingzhi, sleep.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.270
Mr. Xu, Yin, bye.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.110
You found the chief culprit for me.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:40.750
Thanks for the gift.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.880
He was also the chief culprit

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.840
who abducted me.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.440
We each got what we needed.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.200
Nice to work with you.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.590
After Mai Boyuan is dead,

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.720
I'll give you a new life.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.000
You still have a future.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.190
Future?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.110
What future is there for me?

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.960
You can go anywhere you want

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.790
and do anything you like.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.510
But you already

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.590
tried that for me.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.310
In the end, you came back.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.640
You and I are different.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.840
Right.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.720
We're different.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.400
You still have hope.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.130
The man you want to believe in

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.430
is still here.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.840
Good luck.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.620
(Cold Warehouse)

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.830
What's in this thing?

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.040
It weighs a ton.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.560
Fish.

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.440
You should split it

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.280
into smaller crates.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.500
It'd be a lot easier to move.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.620

Not Lu Youliang.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.070
It's Wu Min's parents.
