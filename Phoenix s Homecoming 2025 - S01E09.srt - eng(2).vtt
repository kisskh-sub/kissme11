00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:01.664
(Chaohuang Academy)

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.519
Yunlin,

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:26.439
you're joining the harem?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.719
I met His Majesty
at the lakeside pavilion.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.319
He has already

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.920
issued an edict to make me
Noble Consort Yun.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.040
No way.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.359
That man murdered my father

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.040
and caused my mother's death.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.000
He made us homeless outcasts.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.439
It's too dangerous.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.719
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.400
Yu.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.920
He has ascended the throne

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.040
but keeps neglecting

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.879
state affairs,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760
allowing Chancellor Huo to persecute

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.959
loyal ministers.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.079
He's no true ruler.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.280
Chancellor Huo

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.159
wants to make
the childlike Fourth Prince

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.040
the puppet emperor.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:08.840
If we don't stop them,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.039
the Chen State faces

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.240
only ruin.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.520
If I enter the fray myself,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.759
I might

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.439
defy fate.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.919
Yunlin, say no more.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.840
You once asked me

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.280
the meaning of life.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.520
Here's the answer.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.680
You are of Chen blood.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.840
You are the future sovereign.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.479
You must live for the people

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.080
and the Chen State.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.680
I will also live for you.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.639
Yunlin.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.240
I won't forget

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.439
what you have done for me.

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.960
The state belongs to the Chen family

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.800
and you, Yunlin.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.400
I have come to escort
Noble Consort Yun into the palace.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.520
I, Xie Fei,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.800
have come to escort Noble Consort Yun

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:48.840
into the palace.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.879
You may leave.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:51.720
Your Majesty.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.519
Your Majesty.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.399
Time for your medicine.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.720
Why is it so quiet?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.959
Where is everyone?

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.680
I dismissed them

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.839
so I may serve you personally.

00:05:25.344 --> 00:05:27.279
(Ninth Lord, Chen Ye)

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.759
How diligent of you.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.680
Is this necessary?

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:34.839
You flatter me.

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.199
I'm just worried

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.879
that all those servants

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:42.279
might disturb Your Majesty.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.040
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.480
and scheming.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:48.759
Who are you really?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.120
Why did you enter the palace?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.959
What do you think?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.240
You'd best tell me yourself.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.839
Fine.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.920
Then I shall

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.160
tell Your Majesty the truth.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:13.959
I entered the palace

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.319
to learn from Your Majesty.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.079
I'll learn how to be ruthless,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.120
how to harm the innocent,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.759
and how to slaughter my kin.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.959
Guards.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.160
Guards.

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:29.720
Look around.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.560
Do you see anyone else in this hall?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.079
They say an emperor

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.839
is the loneliest man.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.160
Your Majesty's current state

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.360
truly proves that saying.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.920
You...

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:05.839
Ye.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:13.800
Ye.

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:17.199
I've waited for you
in the underworld for so long.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:19.920
Huayang?

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.759
Is it you, Huayang?

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.192
(Mother of Sheng Yunlin,
Grand Princess Huayang)

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.680
Are you here to take me away?

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:32.040
Ye, before you come with me,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.439
shouldn't you consider

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.240
who to pass the throne to?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.120
Who should I pass it to?

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:43.136
The late Emperor
held the legitimate line.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:45.279
Of his eight sons,
only the Seventh Prince,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.199
Chen Yu, has fine character

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.560
and high intelligence

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:50.839
to be the successor.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.079
If that's what you want,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.959
then he shall take over.

00:08:04.064 --> 00:08:06.816
(Imperial edict: Pass the throne
to the Seventh Prince, Chen Yu.)

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.279
How did His Majesty
suddenly pass away last night?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.320
Could there be some schemes behind this?

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:44.799
The late emperor had few heirs.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.240
The only surviving one

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:48.320
is the feeble-minded Fourth Prince.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.759
How can a fool be the emperor?

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.279
Exactly.

00:08:56.399 --> 00:08:58.200
How could a fool be the emperor?

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.120
I will surely serve

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.960
the Fourth Prince wholeheartedly.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.720
I will spare no effort

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:10.919
for the Chen State's future.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.720
Fourth Prince.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.480
Everyone is waiting.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.759
Prepare for the coronation.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.879
Wait.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.919
W-Who is this?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.600
Princess Changyi.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.519
(Princess Changyi?)

00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:38.496
(The Sheng of Yunnan?)

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.480
(The one beside her
is the Seventh Prince?)

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.519
(They're actually alive?)

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:54.720
The late emperor was wise.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.879
On his deathbed last night,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.120
he wrote a letter of repentance

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.480
and an edict of succession,

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:03.720
passing the throne

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:07.440
to the Seventh Prince, Chen Yu.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.559
(These siblings)

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:11.960
(should have perished long ago.)

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.480
(But they're back here.)

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.200
(You just wouldn't die, huh?)

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.639
(But you have no say
in the Chen State's future.)

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:22.000
Seventh Prince.

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:26.240
Without imperial tutors, how can you

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.200
manage state affairs?

00:10:29.919 --> 00:10:32.799
Qi State in the southwest
covets our land.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.159
Bandits plague the southeast.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.240
The northwest suffers droughts.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.320
The Yellow River floods without cease.

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:43.240
These are grave challenges.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.200
How can an uneducated man

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.039
take on those challenges?

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.759
The Sheng family guards the southwest.

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:52.000
With ample provisions,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.519
they'll resist the Qi troops.

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:56.919
Banditry stems from nobles seizing land,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.879
leaving people homeless.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.399
Send censors to investigate

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:01.480
local governance

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.480
and punish the offenders.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.679
Reduce taxes in the northwest.

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:10.600
Build canals to divert
the Yellow River floods

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:11.759
toward the sea.

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:15.039
Any thoughts, Chancellor?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.679
I, Xie Fei, pay respects
to Your Majesty.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.960
We pay respects to Your Majesty.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.480
Rise, my ministers.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.039
Upon my ascension today,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.279
I appoint Princess Changyi

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:58.639
as Grand Princess of the Chen State.

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:00.840
My knowledge is limited,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.320
and there is much to learn.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.679
Therefore, the Grand Princess

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:08.080
shall act as regent.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:11.240
As regent, I shall

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:12.559
select an empress

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.159
for His Majesty today.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.039
Huo Wan, daughter of Chancellor Huo,

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:21.440
possesses

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.000
both talent and beauty.

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:24.480
She shall preside over

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:26.960
the imperial harem.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.559
We heed your decree.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.159
(Yunlin.)

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:48.519
(I once promised)

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:50.519
(I would grow into a towering tree)

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.679
(to shield you.)

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.000
(But now...)

00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:54.360
Yu.

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:02.600
Yunlin.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.159
Our Yu has grown up.

00:13:47.296 --> 00:13:49.344
(You're invited to the Censorate.)

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.200
(Token)

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.559
Her Highness came to save me.

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:02.519
Where is Her Highness?

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.679
You caused so much trouble,

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:07.600
and you expect Her Highness
to come pick you up?

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:09.960
I wouldn't dare.

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:13.679
I beg Her Highness for help.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.320
There is a way out.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.360
My lord.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Thank Her Highness for sparing my life.
