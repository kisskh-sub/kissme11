00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:12.767
General Su, please wait.

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:16.847
The Minister of Rites has sent me

00:01:16.848 --> 00:01:19.767
to invite you to the Council Hall
to discuss the Gods' Bathing Festival.

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:22.124
You go stroll around
the Imperial Garden first.

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:23.411
Once I'm done with the meeting,

00:01:23.412 --> 00:01:24.687
I'll leave the palace with you.

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:25.567
Alright.

00:01:54.527 --> 00:01:56.687
Your Highness, what is this about?

00:01:56.688 --> 00:01:57.888
Tell me.

00:01:58.647 --> 00:01:59.967
You and him...

00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:02.699
Have you?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.482
Is Your Highness asking

00:02:04.768 --> 00:02:08.368
whether my husband and
I have already done it?

00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:14.761
Changji and I are lawfully married.

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:20.368
Naturally, we do what husband
and wife should do.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:23.287
You!

00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:31.887
What, Your Highness? Are you jealous?

00:02:33.247 --> 00:02:37.487
Or are you regretting why you
slaughtered the Shen that night?

00:02:37.488 --> 00:02:38.287
You!

00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:43.287
You've gone soft?

00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:47.487
When you killed my entire family,

00:02:47.488 --> 00:02:49.967
I didn't see you showing mercy then.

00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:53.847
All those years,

00:02:54.847 --> 00:02:56.447
we walked side by side,

00:02:57.488 --> 00:02:58.927
through life and death,

00:02:58.928 --> 00:02:59.727
sharing hardship.

00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:03.608
And yet you refuse
to trust me even a little?

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:05.806
The killer left behind

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:08.407
a token of the Mobei royal family.

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:10.328
My mother,

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:13.208
my brother, my sister

00:03:13.487 --> 00:03:15.367
all were slain by a soft sword.

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:17.368
Tell me,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.048
who else in the Mobei royal family
uses a soft sword?

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.167
Me.

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:25.567
So how can I trust you?

00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:27.687
Give me some time.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:30.447
I will find the true culprit

00:03:30.448 --> 00:03:31.447
and avenge you.

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:32.567
Stop pretending.

00:03:32.888 --> 00:03:34.407
I've seen enough.

00:03:43.728 --> 00:03:46.048
You're mad, this is the palace!

00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:47.408
General.

00:03:49.608 --> 00:03:51.007
Have you seen my wife?

00:03:51.608 --> 00:03:52.806
Replying to the General,

00:03:52.807 --> 00:03:56.088
I just saw Madam
head to the Imperial Garden.

00:04:02.127 --> 00:04:03.127
Qingru.

00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:05.447
(Oh no.)

00:04:05.768 --> 00:04:06.687
Qingru!

00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:16.887
(No.)

00:04:38.968 --> 00:04:40.087
Qingru!

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.370
Listen.

00:04:42.088 --> 00:04:43.808
Your dear husband

00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:46.007
is about to arrive.

00:04:53.687 --> 00:04:54.808
Tell me.

00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:57.687
If General Su, who has spent
years fighting on the border,

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:00.087
were to see this,

00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:02.007
would he raise his sword against you?

00:05:02.648 --> 00:05:03.870
Yuwen Que,

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:05.887
don't let me hate you.

00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:07.527
Hate?

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.327
Haven't you hated me all along?

00:05:57.887 --> 00:05:58.927
Your Highness.

00:05:58.928 --> 00:05:59.928
Qingru.

00:06:00.408 --> 00:06:01.848
Why are you both here?

00:06:02.937 --> 00:06:04.817
I was taking a walk here.

00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:06.326
I happened to come across Madam Su,

00:06:06.327 --> 00:06:08.186
lost in the Imperial Garden.

00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:09.767
She was so anxious she began to cry.

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:12.313
I meant to lead her to find the General,

00:06:12.648 --> 00:06:14.087
but then you arrived.

00:06:14.648 --> 00:06:15.728
Since that's the case,

00:06:15.887 --> 00:06:18.007
you may take Madam Su and leave.

00:06:37.288 --> 00:06:38.408
General Su,

00:06:39.812 --> 00:06:41.773
do be more careful in the future.

00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:43.524
Do not let your wife

00:06:43.825 --> 00:06:45.864
go missing again due to negligence.

00:06:56.887 --> 00:07:00.368
My family matters
need not trouble Your Highness.

00:07:00.848 --> 00:07:03.087
You should worry more about yourself.

00:07:08.367 --> 00:07:09.248
Your Highness!

00:07:09.447 --> 00:07:10.699
At last I've found you.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.460
His Majesty sent me to find you.

00:07:21.288 --> 00:07:22.087
Qingru.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.527
Qingru, tomorrow I'll bring you
into the palace to watch a show.

00:07:24.887 --> 00:07:26.048
What show?

00:07:28.288 --> 00:07:31.728
A show of righteousness over blood ties.

00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:42.766
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees

00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:45.824
The Crown Prince, Yuwen Que,
led troops against the enemy.

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:47.407
As commander,

00:07:47.408 --> 00:07:49.395
he should have set an example.

00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:50.766
Yet, he failed to return to
the capital when summoned,

00:07:50.767 --> 00:07:52.168
defying military orders,

00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:54.366
dishonoring the virtue of a commander.

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:55.686
His crime must be punished.

00:07:55.687 --> 00:07:57.167
According to our military law,

00:07:57.168 --> 00:07:59.886
he is to receive fifty heavy strokes,

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:03.248
as a warning to all. Thus decreed.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.461
Your Majesty, please spare His Highness!

00:08:13.462 --> 00:08:15.206
He was severely wounded days ago

00:08:15.207 --> 00:08:16.566
and has not yet recovered.

00:08:16.567 --> 00:08:18.527
He cannot endure new injuries.

00:08:21.408 --> 00:08:24.728
Your Majesty, please spare His Highness!

00:08:25.247 --> 00:08:28.968
Your Majesty, please spare His Highness!

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:33.527
Your Majesty, please spare His Highness!

00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:37.206
Is Your Majesty troubled
because of His Highness?

00:08:37.207 --> 00:08:40.887
How could I not feel pain for my son?

00:08:40.888 --> 00:08:44.446
But for the sake of a lowly woman,

00:08:44.447 --> 00:08:46.047
he behaves so recklessly.

00:08:46.487 --> 00:08:48.287
I am deeply disappointed.

00:08:48.368 --> 00:08:52.007
Your Majesty, Princess Wen Ling
is deeply devoted to His Highness.

00:08:52.008 --> 00:08:54.047
Why not grant them a marriage?

00:08:54.087 --> 00:08:55.446
Once His Highness is settled,

00:08:55.447 --> 00:08:56.749
he will surely become more steady.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.109
That makes sense.

00:08:58.207 --> 00:09:02.636
However, I must choose
an auspicious date for them.

00:09:02.637 --> 00:09:04.874
In a few days comes
the Gods' Bathing Festival,

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:07.767
a time when young men and women meet.

00:09:07.888 --> 00:09:09.007
Great.

00:09:10.087 --> 00:09:11.474
At that time,

00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:14.536
I shall grant them the marriage.

00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:16.018
Your Majesty is wise.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.007
Your Majesty.

00:09:31.087 --> 00:09:33.149
Eunuch, will His Majesty see me?

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.269
Your Ladyship, when
a prince breaks the law,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.870
he is punished the same as a commoner.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.689
Though His Majesty
loves His Highness dearly,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.386
he cannot bend the law
for personal feelings.

00:09:40.387 --> 00:09:42.367
So Your Ladyship, please go back.

00:09:42.368 --> 00:09:45.486
I cannot stand by
and watch him suffer more injuries.

00:09:45.487 --> 00:09:47.927
Eunuch, please plead for him once more.

00:09:49.048 --> 00:09:50.167
Your Ladyship.

00:09:50.447 --> 00:09:53.611
I advise you to go and stay by
His Highness instead.

00:09:53.612 --> 00:09:55.486
He has just been flogged.

00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:58.088
He needs someone by his side.

00:09:58.607 --> 00:10:00.486
This is your chance.

00:10:00.487 --> 00:10:02.007
Thank you for your guidance, Eunuch.

00:10:56.408 --> 00:10:59.368
The punishment is complete.
The court is dismissed.

00:11:02.112 --> 00:11:02.887
Your Highness!

00:11:02.888 --> 00:11:03.688
Your Highness!

00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:07.887
Those executioners

00:11:07.888 --> 00:11:09.486
struck without mercy.

00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:10.368
It's nothing.

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:13.206
This "gift" from General Su...

00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:16.957
One day, I will return it double.

00:11:17.207 --> 00:11:21.167
Then I shall await it.

00:11:46.687 --> 00:11:49.527
Qingru, why are you crying?

00:11:49.847 --> 00:11:52.328
Did you get scared just now?

00:11:52.687 --> 00:11:55.767
Perhaps the wind was too strong
and made my eyes water.
