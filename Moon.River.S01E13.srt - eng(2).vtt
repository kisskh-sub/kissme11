00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:27.575
Please stop.

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:29.235
Please stop.

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:32.775
- Oh, my. Your sash is crooked. - What is your problem?

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.025
What are you waiting for? Beat them to a pulp!

00:00:58.535 --> 00:00:59.535
What on earth?

00:01:45.245 --> 00:01:48.485
How dare you glare at me, you jerk?

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:50.385
No!

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:57.995
It seems you truly have a death wish.

00:01:58.895 --> 00:01:59.895
Very well.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.965
- Die! - What do you think you are doing?

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:25.585
It is hard for a ruined noblewoman to be a brewer.

00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:27.725
I imagine you have to deal with plenty of scoundrels.

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:31.825
Your father must be weeping in the skies.

00:02:32.425 --> 00:02:34.335
So, stay firm.

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:38.305
And you, get stronger.

00:02:38.705 --> 00:02:42.005
I would have won if that geezer had not fought dirty.

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:44.605
All talk from a sore loser.

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:45.945
Come on.

00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:49.475
Thank you, my lord.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:53.385
Of course. If you get in trouble, come straight to me.

00:02:55.115 --> 00:02:57.985
I will protect this fledgling until he is ready to leave the nest.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:02:59.585
I am leaving.

00:03:08.235 --> 00:03:09.235
Let me see.

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:12.935
Oh, no. This is going to leave a scar.

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:30.255
Are you even training properly for the military service exam?

00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:32.825
Do you want to spend your life as a good-for-nothing?

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:36.555
You have to pass this time!

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:42.935
Once I pass the military service examination,

00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:44.965
and I am strong enough to protect you,

00:03:45.865 --> 00:03:48.335
then can I be your husband?

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:54.275
Pass the exam first, then we will talk.

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:07.025
- What do we do? - Oh, dear.

00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:08.695
First in the military service exam.

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:10.425
Kim Han Chul.

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:16.535
How much is this hairpin?

00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:17.865
It is 100 nyang.

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:19.535
It is 100 nyang?

00:04:20.835 --> 00:04:24.375
- Then what about this one? - Yes. That one is 50 nyang.

00:04:25.275 --> 00:04:28.275
The cheapest one I have is 15 nyang.

00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:36.915
A gift for you.

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:49.295
It is a hair ribbon.

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:51.635
I hear the Marriage Ban is about to be issued.

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:22.665
For the military exam's top scorer to be the last one to stay...

00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:26.665
and train each day. Is that not a bit unfair?

00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:28.075
Your Majesty.

00:05:29.175 --> 00:05:30.405
How did you know I was here?

00:05:30.805 --> 00:05:32.445
Were you not hoping I would notice?

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:35.075
Have a seat.

00:05:35.815 --> 00:05:36.815
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:05:40.245 --> 00:05:42.915
Tell me, what is your dream?

00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:49.395
My dream is to become stronger.

00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:51.965
There is someone I wish to protect.

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:55.865
I see. We are kindred spirits, then. Our dreams are the same.

00:05:57.905 --> 00:06:00.735
How could I be a kindred spirit, Your Majesty?

00:06:00.805 --> 00:06:02.335
Those who share the same aspirations are kindred spirits.

00:06:04.775 --> 00:06:06.275
And those who share a meal are friends.

00:06:08.975 --> 00:06:10.945
I am grateful for your grace, Your Majesty.

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:21.825
A gift from your new friend.

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:32.005
Finally, I can breathe a little easier.

00:06:32.405 --> 00:06:34.035
The palace is suffocating enough as it is.

00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:37.875
And if I must have this wedding to a woman my Royal Mother chose,

00:06:38.175 --> 00:06:39.205
I might just suffocate to death.

00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:42.615
Who are you men?

00:06:43.475 --> 00:06:45.845
How about you hand over any money you have?

00:06:46.885 --> 00:06:47.915
Please stay back.

00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:52.325
I have three bites left. Finish them off before I am done.

00:07:17.615 --> 00:07:18.615
Your Majesty!

00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:24.485
I was the one fighting. Why are you the one who got hurt?

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:27.725
That is what friends are for. Sharing the pain.

00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:31.495
We cannot go back to the palace like this.

00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:33.665
Is there somewhere we can get this treated?

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.735
Please come to my house.

00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:43.275
I am coming in.

00:07:53.185 --> 00:07:54.455
She is my neighbor.

00:07:54.915 --> 00:07:55.915
I see.

00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:58.725
Please do me a favor and help me.

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:19.875
Why would you give this greenhouse to me?

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.315
- This is too much. - A thank you for the other day.

00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:25.185
And a bribe of sorts.

00:08:26.685 --> 00:08:28.185
To get on your good side.

00:08:33.255 --> 00:08:34.255
What do you think?

00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:36.495
We look pretty good together, do we not?

00:08:45.435 --> 00:08:46.435
My apologies.

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.035
Please forgive my rudeness for leaving first.

00:09:01.655 --> 00:09:04.215
You said you wanted to be strong to protect someone, did you not?

00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:07.355
That must be Lady Ji Hye.

00:09:08.695 --> 00:09:10.825
But compared to a mere military man like you,

00:09:11.725 --> 00:09:14.025
do you not think I can protect her better as the King?

00:09:14.465 --> 00:09:16.965
And it is not like you would ever defy me.

00:09:17.735 --> 00:09:18.735
We are friends, after all.

00:09:30.475 --> 00:09:33.645
Are you not even angry? How can you just stand by and watch?

00:09:34.415 --> 00:09:35.455
His Majesty...

00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:38.855
will protect you better than anyone else.

00:09:40.385 --> 00:09:41.455
Because he is the King.

00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:45.025
I am no match for him.

00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:47.965
He is the most powerful man in the world.

00:10:04.375 --> 00:10:05.715
I am going to blow out the candle.

00:10:28.405 --> 00:10:31.145
- A firstborn prince, Your Majesty. - A son.

00:10:34.405 --> 00:10:35.415
And the Queen?

00:10:37.445 --> 00:10:40.745
- Is she all right? - Yes, Her Highness is safe as well.

00:11:08.315 --> 00:11:11.945
I simply cannot ignore that prophecy.

00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:14.115
Are you speaking of the Queen again?

00:11:14.655 --> 00:11:17.655
- She has not committed any crime. - A crime? We can just invent one.

00:11:19.525 --> 00:11:20.955
Your Majesty!

00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:25.025
You must punish the Queen severely for her adultery!

00:11:25.095 --> 00:11:26.995
How could Her Highness commit adultery?

00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:31.465
Your Majesty, I beg of you, please clear Her Highness's name!

00:11:33.205 --> 00:11:35.835
The man in the affair with the Queen has confessed.

00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:38.845
I lost to my Royal Mother.

00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:42.915
You should see the Queen off on her final journey.

00:12:10.605 --> 00:12:12.175
How did you get in here?

00:12:13.005 --> 00:12:15.545
His Majesty will serve you the royal poison tomorrow.

00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:17.875
You have to escape now.

00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:19.685
Where do you...

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:21.715
expect me to go?

00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:23.885
I will take you.

00:12:24.755 --> 00:12:28.725
I will protect you, Your Highness. So please come away with me.

00:12:39.005 --> 00:12:40.205
If I run away,

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:43.805
the Crown Prince will be known as the son of an adulteress...

00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:46.605
and be scorned for the rest of his life.

00:12:47.905 --> 00:12:50.015
He might even lose his life.

00:12:57.385 --> 00:12:58.885
Can you please just live?

00:12:59.955 --> 00:13:01.425
Please, I beg you, live.

00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:04.295
Please live.

00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:09.765
Please live.

00:13:14.535 --> 00:13:15.535
I am sorry.

00:14:02.085 --> 00:14:04.015
Put this medicine in the royal poison.

00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:06.285
She will vomit some blood,

00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:08.355
but it will stop the poison from spreading.

00:14:14.995 --> 00:14:18.105
Then give her this antidote as quickly as possible.

00:15:13.255 --> 00:15:14.255
Your Highness.

00:15:18.025 --> 00:15:20.365
Your Highness. Are you all right?

00:15:23.865 --> 00:15:24.865
Your Highness?

00:15:27.305 --> 00:15:28.305
Un.

00:15:29.305 --> 00:15:30.305
My Un.

00:15:34.575 --> 00:15:35.575
Un.

00:15:39.545 --> 00:15:40.585
Un.

00:15:45.055 --> 00:15:47.025
- My Un. - Your Highness.

00:15:47.625 --> 00:15:48.725
What is wrong?

00:15:52.495 --> 00:15:53.495
Who are you?

00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:56.635
Your Highness.

00:16:21.955 --> 00:16:25.395
I gave up a queen and protected much in return,

00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:28.495
so I suppose it was a fair trade.

00:16:30.435 --> 00:16:31.865
Did you not...

00:16:32.865 --> 00:16:35.375
love the Queen?

00:16:37.305 --> 00:16:38.305
You promised...

00:16:39.545 --> 00:16:41.145
you would protect her.

00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:43.675
Did you not?

00:16:46.645 --> 00:16:48.045
What I wanted to protect...

00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:51.155
was not some foolish emotion like love,

00:16:52.855 --> 00:16:54.025
but the throne.

00:16:55.395 --> 00:16:56.495
Strong royal authority.

00:17:25.155 --> 00:17:28.085
A sword, too, was once merely iron.

00:17:29.355 --> 00:17:30.855
The iron became a sword,

00:17:32.165 --> 00:17:34.165
and that blade is made to sin...

00:17:35.065 --> 00:17:36.795
all because of love.

00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:46.805
(Chapter 13: A Sword's Purpose)

00:17:47.345 --> 00:17:48.345
The Crown Prince...

00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:52.185
The Crown Prince...

00:17:52.615 --> 00:17:54.585
sent Je Un to Mount Gamak?

00:17:55.085 --> 00:17:57.014
He returned by himself without the Left Flank Guard.

00:17:57.015 --> 00:17:59.255
The Crown Princess must be at Mount Gamak.

00:17:59.585 --> 00:18:01.355
Should you not send the Royal Guards?

00:18:02.425 --> 00:18:04.355
The Left State Councilor is on high alert right now.

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.195
I will wait for the opportune moment to make a move.

00:18:08.835 --> 00:18:11.134
But is it safe to leave the Crown Princess's family...

00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:13.335
at Unjeong Palace?

00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:16.505
Right. I trust you to protect them.

00:18:17.005 --> 00:18:18.105
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:22.375
It is not safe at Unjeong Palace, so you all must move.

00:18:22.545 --> 00:18:24.745
But what about our Dal? What happened to our daughter?

00:18:24.945 --> 00:18:28.255
I heard from the servants that the Crown Prince was captured.

00:18:28.315 --> 00:18:29.955
Please do not worry.

00:18:30.515 --> 00:18:34.025
His Highness sent Grand Prince Un to the Crown Princess.

00:18:34.955 --> 00:18:38.155
Where is Her Highness?

00:18:41.735 --> 00:18:42.835
Well...

00:18:45.105 --> 00:18:46.235
Gamak...

00:18:46.765 --> 00:18:48.304
No, you must not.

00:18:48.305 --> 00:18:51.005
It is too risky to go to Her Highness.

00:18:52.445 --> 00:18:55.775
Hey, how long have you been a palace eunuch?

00:18:57.615 --> 00:19:01.415
- I started here in the Gyesa Year. - Gyesa?

00:19:02.685 --> 00:19:03.955
Darn it, Gyesa Yer?

00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:09.454
How dare a round-faced pipsqueak who became a eunuch in Gyesa Year...

00:19:09.455 --> 00:19:11.495
talk back to me?

00:19:11.825 --> 00:19:12.825
Let me tell you.

00:19:13.665 --> 00:19:15.035
I started back in the Gyeongo Year.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:21.235
- I see. - Oh, "you see," is it?

00:19:24.535 --> 00:19:27.345
I ought to knock some corners into that round head of yours.

00:19:28.175 --> 00:19:30.545
Just tell us. Where is our daughter?

00:19:30.615 --> 00:19:33.085
We owe our lives to Her Highness.

00:19:34.415 --> 00:19:35.785
Please tell us.

00:19:41.755 --> 00:19:42.795
My apologies.

00:19:43.655 --> 00:19:45.894
I heard the Crown Princess would leave to Qing.

00:19:45.895 --> 00:19:47.995
The Nameless men are lying in ambush...

00:19:48.265 --> 00:19:49.965
on all roads, even Jemulpo, to Qing.

00:19:53.305 --> 00:19:54.305
Mount Gamak.

00:19:54.665 --> 00:19:58.135
I know exactly what you are hiding on Mount Gamak.

00:19:58.745 --> 00:19:59.745
If I die here today,

00:20:00.345 --> 00:20:02.375
the Crown Prince will reveal your secret.

00:20:27.005 --> 00:20:28.005
It is different.

00:20:45.955 --> 00:20:46.955
Candle wax.

00:21:06.305 --> 00:21:08.775
(Cross Mount Gamak's Ungye bridge, and you will find a forbidden rope.)

00:21:12.015 --> 00:21:13.015
Found it.

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:22.295
My lord. Are you sure you will be safe alone?

00:21:23.055 --> 00:21:24.295
Let me go with you.

00:21:24.355 --> 00:21:27.665
No. Deliver this letter to Eunuch Yoon.

00:21:28.695 --> 00:21:29.765
Yes, my lord.

00:21:30.535 --> 00:21:32.605
Please be careful.

00:21:33.265 --> 00:21:36.175
Do not worry. I can handle myself in a fight.

00:22:42.935 --> 00:22:46.105
I found The Nameless' fortress from the military treatise.

00:22:46.305 --> 00:22:48.645
I will be back in three days, at the latest.

00:22:49.975 --> 00:22:52.315
(Cross Mount Gamak's Ungye bridge, and you will find a forbidden rope.)

00:22:56.855 --> 00:22:57.855
Three days.

00:23:15.605 --> 00:23:17.875
The Office of Astronomy has chosen an auspicious day.

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:26.515
(Auspicious Day: The Ninth of the Seventh Month)

00:23:29.355 --> 00:23:31.115
The auspicious day is two days from now.

00:23:32.225 --> 00:23:33.955
So much for not fearing the skies.

00:23:35.555 --> 00:23:37.995
Have you finally decided to play the Almighty?

00:23:39.265 --> 00:23:40.694
Do you think I do not know it was you...

00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:41.965
who chose this "auspicious day"?

00:23:42.395 --> 00:23:43.695
Your Majesty.

00:23:44.995 --> 00:23:48.305
Do you still believe in the skies?

00:23:55.845 --> 00:23:57.375
Time is of the essence.

00:23:58.545 --> 00:24:01.915
Please issue the royal edict today and proceed with the Royal Wedding.

00:24:05.055 --> 00:24:06.585
By order of the King,

00:24:07.255 --> 00:24:09.455
in the matter of the Crown Prince taking a spouse,

00:24:10.055 --> 00:24:12.795
we have consulted the skies and chosen an auspicious day.

00:24:13.295 --> 00:24:15.794
The ninth day of the seventh month, which is in two days,

00:24:15.795 --> 00:24:17.395
is designated for the Royal Wedding,

00:24:17.795 --> 00:24:19.865
so it is decreed.

00:24:31.845 --> 00:24:32.915
Yeo Ri...

00:24:34.485 --> 00:24:36.115
Was she laid to rest properly?

00:24:38.285 --> 00:24:39.285
Yes, Your Highness.

00:24:40.585 --> 00:24:43.055
Your Highness, about the Royal Wedding in two days...

00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:45.325
Send Yeo Ri's mother money for the funeral,

00:24:46.265 --> 00:24:47.625
and send her some medicine.

00:24:50.335 --> 00:24:53.235
It is the last thing I can do for them.

00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:57.675
Pass along that I am sorry.

00:24:59.775 --> 00:25:00.775
Yes, Your Highness.

00:25:03.075 --> 00:25:06.945
I suppose you wrote the National Code too?

00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:11.485
Despite the Royal Order to admit no one,

00:25:11.755 --> 00:25:13.255
I see you are an exception.

00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:16.955
You look well.

00:25:17.895 --> 00:25:20.194
For someone who just sent his wife away to Qing.

00:25:20.195 --> 00:25:22.165
I suppose I should be sick with grief.

00:25:22.965 --> 00:25:24.135
My apologies.

00:25:24.365 --> 00:25:28.265
If I had known Your Highness was the same kind of man as I,

00:25:29.035 --> 00:25:31.135
I would have cast you aside long ago.

00:25:32.745 --> 00:25:34.275
But it is too late for that.

00:25:36.275 --> 00:25:40.085
Why did you return to the palace?

00:25:44.085 --> 00:25:46.755
Where have you hidden the Deposed Crown Princess?

00:25:48.995 --> 00:25:51.655
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:25:51.725 --> 00:25:55.295
I know that you will not give up on your revenge.

00:25:56.195 --> 00:25:59.565
And that is why I have come to tell you this.

00:26:00.605 --> 00:26:01.705
In two days,

00:26:03.775 --> 00:26:04.935
the Royal Wedding will be held.

00:26:09.675 --> 00:26:12.815
With that, I will take my leave.

00:26:22.695 --> 00:26:24.095
But one thing.

00:26:30.695 --> 00:26:32.305
The Deposed Crown Princess is alive,

00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:35.875
so why are you still bent on revenge?

00:26:38.635 --> 00:26:40.245
She remembers you,

00:26:41.505 --> 00:26:43.915
and she is alive and well, is she not?

00:26:46.585 --> 00:26:48.045
You tore us apart,

00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:50.555
and you ask me why I am dreaming of revenge?

00:26:53.455 --> 00:26:54.685
Parting...

00:26:58.795 --> 00:27:02.935
The Royal Family is always so greedy.

00:27:19.685 --> 00:27:21.085
Sir, the Royal Wedding is in two days.

00:27:21.445 --> 00:27:22.955
Are you not pushing yourself too hard?

00:27:23.715 --> 00:27:24.955
Let me go alone.

00:27:27.885 --> 00:27:28.925
Let us go.

00:27:34.465 --> 00:27:36.835
The Left State Councilor has left the capital.

00:27:38.335 --> 00:27:39.365
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:27:39.935 --> 00:27:42.875
We confirmed he left through Donuimun Gate.

00:27:45.605 --> 00:27:46.775
To the Eastern Palace.

00:28:01.585 --> 00:28:02.995
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:05.725
Wait, that is..

00:28:07.795 --> 00:28:09.965
- Your Highness! - Where are you going?

00:28:10.195 --> 00:28:11.435
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

00:28:15.605 --> 00:28:17.604
- Your Highness! - You are confined.

00:28:17.605 --> 00:28:19.205
You cannot leave!

00:28:20.045 --> 00:28:21.745
- Come on! - Your Highness!

00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:24.445
- Move! Get out of my way! - Please go back inside.

00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:26.245
- Let go of me! - Your Highness!

00:28:26.645 --> 00:28:30.155
- His Majesty, the King, is here! - Goodness!

00:28:34.655 --> 00:28:35.995
What is the meaning of this?

00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:39.865
I refuse to go through with the Royal Wedding.

00:28:40.395 --> 00:28:43.135
If I cannot help, the least I can do is not be a burden.

00:28:44.035 --> 00:28:46.035
If you run away now, it will all have been for nothing.

00:28:46.105 --> 00:28:47.405
I am not trying to run away.

00:28:48.235 --> 00:28:51.705
Prince Je Un said he would be back by the day after tomorrow.

00:28:52.305 --> 00:28:53.675
He said he would, so he will.

00:28:55.005 --> 00:28:56.075
But on the off chance...

00:28:57.275 --> 00:28:59.415
that he does not make it back by then,

00:29:00.545 --> 00:29:02.855
then I will go. Please lend me the Royal Guards.

00:29:03.285 --> 00:29:05.215
I have already sent my most trusted Royal Guards.

00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:06.425
I have to go too.

00:29:06.725 --> 00:29:08.155
I cannot just send someone into danger...

00:29:08.385 --> 00:29:10.795
and then sit back and do nothing myself.

00:29:10.895 --> 00:29:11.925
Gang.

00:29:13.925 --> 00:29:15.165
Let us have faith in Je Un.

00:29:15.895 --> 00:29:18.665
In case Je Un does not return before the wedding procession,

00:29:20.265 --> 00:29:21.705
then you go to the Crown Princess.

00:29:23.135 --> 00:29:24.735
I will take care of the rest.

00:29:26.975 --> 00:29:29.515
Thank you. Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:29:51.995 --> 00:29:53.005
Please...

00:29:53.735 --> 00:29:55.465
keep His Highness safe.

00:29:56.135 --> 00:29:57.175
Please.

00:30:01.545 --> 00:30:03.075
Please help me.

00:30:04.075 --> 00:30:05.575
Please see me through this.

00:30:06.945 --> 00:30:08.215
Let me end all of this...

00:30:11.955 --> 00:30:13.525
so I can protect Dal.

00:30:17.555 --> 00:30:20.395
I am sorry I am late. I had to be sure I was not followed.

00:30:21.325 --> 00:30:22.335
So, you are here.

00:30:27.235 --> 00:30:29.635
We were wondering if you would show up or not.

00:30:30.235 --> 00:30:32.544
We were worried you would not show.

00:30:32.545 --> 00:30:33.975
That is what I meant.

00:30:36.645 --> 00:30:38.645
Yes, I was very worried as well.

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:41.845
Do you know how worried I was when I heard what happened?

00:30:42.185 --> 00:30:44.285
You could have been killed.

00:30:44.815 --> 00:30:46.285
Here we go again.

00:30:46.955 --> 00:30:48.925
Why look at another man's woman with such tenderness?

00:30:50.025 --> 00:30:51.195
Cut it out.

00:30:51.395 --> 00:30:52.424
Please.

00:30:52.425 --> 00:30:53.595
Okay?

00:30:56.265 --> 00:30:59.435
Back when she was the Crown Princess,

00:30:59.935 --> 00:31:01.835
was she always this prickly?

00:31:02.135 --> 00:31:06.145
She was not. It must be His Highness's influence.

00:31:06.305 --> 00:31:09.315
Like husband, like wife.

00:31:09.875 --> 00:31:12.585
It feels like I am with my brother. You feel it too?

00:31:12.785 --> 00:31:13.845
I suppose.

00:31:14.285 --> 00:31:15.515
I can hear everything you are saying.

00:31:15.855 --> 00:31:17.654
You heard that?

00:31:17.655 --> 00:31:19.825
I meant for you to, so I am glad.

00:31:19.885 --> 00:31:22.025
- Why you... - Your Highness!

00:31:22.355 --> 00:31:23.895
A little decorum, please.

00:31:26.395 --> 00:31:29.465
- You brought the military treatise? - Oh, right.

00:31:29.865 --> 00:31:33.535
Of course. Who do you think I am? Let us talk inside.

00:31:41.675 --> 00:31:43.445
(Mount Songak)

00:31:44.675 --> 00:31:46.015
(Cross Mount Gamak's Ungye bridge, and you will find a forbidden rope.)

00:31:49.185 --> 00:31:50.285
Finally.

00:31:50.815 --> 00:31:52.785
I have finally found their mountain fortress.

00:31:53.225 --> 00:31:56.495
I will go at once. Your Highness, please wait here.

00:31:56.555 --> 00:31:57.555
I am going with you.

00:31:58.925 --> 00:32:00.265
I will not get in the way.

00:32:01.265 --> 00:32:03.095
(Search: Gyeonggi)

00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:10.235
(Mount Gamak)

00:32:10.875 --> 00:32:14.745
Cross Mount Gamak's Ungye bridge, and you will find a forbidden rope.

00:32:16.615 --> 00:32:17.615
Over there.

00:32:18.115 --> 00:32:20.215
That is the forbidden rope. Let us go.

00:32:24.885 --> 00:32:26.255
Once you pass the forbidden rope,

00:32:27.725 --> 00:32:30.655
you will find a fallen birch tree with their symbol on it.

00:32:31.095 --> 00:32:32.095
My lord!

00:32:38.065 --> 00:32:41.765
Follow the symbols, and they will lead you to the fortress.

00:32:41.835 --> 00:32:43.035
(The Nameless's Mountain Fortress)

00:32:43.105 --> 00:32:44.805
This is the stronghold of The Nameless.

00:32:45.205 --> 00:32:48.775
They deal in counterfeiting coins, illegal weapon manufacturing,

00:32:49.375 --> 00:32:50.815
loan sharking, human trafficking, and more.

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:53.645
They are a vicious band of criminals.

00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:02.695
I proved the Left State Councilor is the Jimjo's master,

00:33:02.855 --> 00:33:06.425
but then this secret pact appeared and made this whole mess.

00:33:07.595 --> 00:33:10.665
If the Left State Councilor dies, the secret pact gets released.

00:33:10.765 --> 00:33:13.535
That clearly means he entrusted it to someone.

00:33:14.965 --> 00:33:17.305
And the most likely suspect is this guy.

00:33:17.835 --> 00:33:19.245
The one in the Choraengi Mask.

00:33:20.175 --> 00:33:24.975
He used the Cheonghye Merchant Guild to get the Jimjo's feed inside.

00:33:25.345 --> 00:33:28.315
And their backer is The Nameless.

00:33:29.585 --> 00:33:30.815
The mountain fortress.

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:34.185
Six years ago,

00:33:34.985 --> 00:33:36.355
on Mount Gamak,

00:33:36.825 --> 00:33:39.665
I swear I saw the woman in white and The Nameless there.

00:33:40.195 --> 00:33:41.695
Please take me to the palace.

00:33:43.795 --> 00:33:44.865
This letter...

00:33:45.235 --> 00:33:46.405
(Letter)

00:33:49.575 --> 00:33:51.205
(Secret pact)

00:33:53.275 --> 00:33:55.045
(Mount Gamak)

00:33:56.815 --> 00:33:58.745
(Mountain fortress, Mount Gamak, Woman in white, letter)

00:34:00.945 --> 00:34:01.945
Wait.

00:34:04.015 --> 00:34:05.255
The woman in white.

00:34:06.425 --> 00:34:07.455
The letter.

00:34:09.185 --> 00:34:10.225
The secret pact?

00:34:11.155 --> 00:34:13.795
The woman in white, the letter, the secret pact?

00:34:14.925 --> 00:34:15.965
This letter...

00:34:21.465 --> 00:34:24.675
(Coup, meritorious contributor)

00:34:26.675 --> 00:34:28.705
- The secret pact. - I said move!

00:34:28.775 --> 00:34:29.815
You must not, Your Majesty.

00:34:30.815 --> 00:34:31.945
Out of my way!

00:34:34.345 --> 00:34:35.345
Your Majesty.

00:34:57.775 --> 00:35:00.545
- One! Two! - One!

00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:02.305
- Two! - Three!

00:35:03.115 --> 00:35:05.515
At ease! One!

00:35:06.185 --> 00:35:07.185
Two!

00:35:07.785 --> 00:35:08.785
Three!

00:35:15.285 --> 00:35:17.495
The security is very tight there. It is suspicious,

00:35:18.425 --> 00:35:19.425
sir.

00:35:20.695 --> 00:35:22.695
We should get a closer look.

00:35:31.305 --> 00:35:33.745
What on earth are you doing here?

00:35:34.245 --> 00:35:36.915
If you stay here, you will be in the crossfire too.

00:35:37.015 --> 00:35:39.845
I am already prepared to be incarcerated anyway.

00:35:40.245 --> 00:35:43.485
And what is with this tone of yours?

00:35:45.055 --> 00:35:46.185
That is...

00:35:48.755 --> 00:35:49.895
Well...

00:35:50.225 --> 00:35:54.225
I have been around Dal a lot. I guess her speech rubbed off on me.

00:35:55.725 --> 00:35:58.295
The Royal Concubine... No, the Crown Princess.

00:35:58.635 --> 00:36:00.405
How is she?

00:36:04.735 --> 00:36:06.805
I can only pray that she is safe.

00:36:07.645 --> 00:36:09.175
There is nothing more I can do.

00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:13.485
Then make use of me.

00:36:18.855 --> 00:36:21.125
The tragedy of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess...

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:25.525
was all my fault.

00:36:27.225 --> 00:36:28.225
Pardon?

00:36:29.095 --> 00:36:31.435
What do you mean?

00:36:32.435 --> 00:36:35.905
What do you mean by incarceration? And how could it be your fault?

00:36:38.335 --> 00:36:39.975
The Gyesa Year Incident...

00:36:41.445 --> 00:36:43.715
was the Left State Councilor's revenge.

00:36:44.945 --> 00:36:49.345
Revenge for the woman he loved being stolen by the Royal Family.

00:36:53.555 --> 00:36:57.355
Revenge for her miserable death.

00:36:58.225 --> 00:37:02.695
You are saying that the bloodbath was all for the sake of revenge?

00:37:04.365 --> 00:37:05.965
Come to think of it,

00:37:07.805 --> 00:37:10.235
for a simple grab for power,

00:37:11.675 --> 00:37:14.205
his methods were too elaborate.

00:37:15.345 --> 00:37:18.975
He even spread rumors of Queen Jangjeong's ghost.

00:37:19.245 --> 00:37:21.115
He used those rumors as a pretext...

00:37:21.445 --> 00:37:24.585
to reopen the false adultery case.

00:37:25.515 --> 00:37:28.585
The people he killed in the Gyesa Year...

00:37:30.725 --> 00:37:32.025
Every last one of them...

00:37:32.525 --> 00:37:35.025
was connected to Queen Jangjeong.

00:37:37.335 --> 00:37:39.265
The more the Left State Councilor's crimes pile up,

00:37:40.365 --> 00:37:42.565
the more my own guilt grows.

00:37:44.775 --> 00:37:45.975
I must put a stop to it.

00:37:47.275 --> 00:37:50.715
So, if you need anything at all,

00:37:51.615 --> 00:37:52.945
just say the word.

00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:01.525
I need to see...

00:38:02.185 --> 00:38:03.495
Queen Jangjeong for myself.

00:38:14.935 --> 00:38:16.275
Wait, so the woman in white...

00:38:17.335 --> 00:38:19.545
was really Prince Je Un's mother?

00:38:30.885 --> 00:38:32.055
Royal Mother!

00:38:33.025 --> 00:38:34.125
Royal Mother!

00:38:34.885 --> 00:38:36.085
Mother!

00:38:40.295 --> 00:38:41.295
Mother.

00:38:51.035 --> 00:38:53.305
- You cannot go now. - Let go of me.

00:38:54.005 --> 00:38:56.045
If you go out there now, you will ruin everything.

00:38:57.415 --> 00:38:58.445
I know this is hard for you,

00:38:59.115 --> 00:39:00.115
but please...

00:39:01.615 --> 00:39:04.985
This should be enough to prove this fortress is an illegal den.

00:39:05.455 --> 00:39:07.585
Go to the Capital Garrison Command and request reinforcements.

00:39:19.805 --> 00:39:21.735
The Crown Princess Consort asked me to give this to Choraengi Mask.

00:39:22.105 --> 00:39:25.775
She said Choraengi Mask has a scar by her mouth, like a fingernail.

00:39:32.115 --> 00:39:33.915
You are Choraengi Mask, are you not?

00:39:34.385 --> 00:39:36.715
Daughter of Kim Deok Chun and Yun Gye Sim.

00:39:45.855 --> 00:39:47.125
This is a letter from the Crown Princess Consort.

00:40:06.645 --> 00:40:07.685
My lord.

00:40:19.225 --> 00:40:21.395
Your mother died three years ago.

00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:23.635
I promise you,

00:40:25.195 --> 00:40:26.805
I am going to ruin my father.

00:40:28.165 --> 00:40:29.975
So, you need to get away from him.

00:40:32.005 --> 00:40:34.205
Do not be tied down to anything anymore.

00:40:35.345 --> 00:40:36.575
Go and be free.

00:40:39.445 --> 00:40:40.445
Leave.

00:40:41.615 --> 00:40:44.715
My mother's life is in the Left State Councilor's hands,

00:40:45.115 --> 00:40:46.385
so I am not going anywhere.

00:40:47.985 --> 00:40:50.225
Do not disappoint me again.

00:40:50.725 --> 00:40:53.865
Your mother deserves to be free, does she not?

00:40:56.435 --> 00:40:57.435
Is it true?

00:40:59.865 --> 00:41:02.405
I do not know what your relationship with the Crown Princess Consort is,

00:41:02.735 --> 00:41:06.405
but to get that letter to you, she took a great many risks.

00:41:07.345 --> 00:41:08.645
If you cannot bring yourself to trust us,

00:41:09.105 --> 00:41:10.145
then trust Crown Princess Consort.

00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:34.365
Tonight,

00:41:34.835 --> 00:41:37.005
the forces of The Nameless will march on the capital.

00:41:37.905 --> 00:41:40.405
I will help you. You can escape after they have left.

00:41:40.705 --> 00:41:41.875
Why are The Nameless going to the capital?

00:41:42.345 --> 00:41:44.515
The Royal Wedding is tomorrow.

00:41:47.345 --> 00:41:50.415
The Left State Councilor knows you are all on Mount Gamak.

00:41:51.085 --> 00:41:52.155
You need to be careful.

00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:53.885
Wait.

00:41:55.555 --> 00:41:58.725
Do you happen to know anything about a secret pact?

00:42:00.825 --> 00:42:02.665
I am not sure it is the secret pact,

00:42:04.795 --> 00:42:08.205
but it seems there is something important in those quarters.

00:42:08.635 --> 00:42:09.635
And what is that?

00:42:10.275 --> 00:42:12.175
Whenever the head of our order gets drunk,

00:42:12.935 --> 00:42:14.905
he mentions entrusting a key item to a woman who is not of sound mind,

00:42:15.545 --> 00:42:18.775
and says he can never understand the Left State Councilor.

00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:20.615
Not of sound mind?

00:42:22.985 --> 00:42:24.755
For about 15 years now, I hear.

00:42:25.255 --> 00:42:27.185
When she has a rare lucid moment and tries to escape,

00:42:27.455 --> 00:42:29.555
I heard she takes that object with her.

00:42:34.225 --> 00:42:35.465
My Royal Mother...

00:42:36.365 --> 00:42:37.395
But how?

00:42:43.335 --> 00:42:45.734
If she is the Left State Councilor's weakness,

00:42:45.735 --> 00:42:47.745
he will bring his full force to bear.

00:42:48.745 --> 00:42:51.715
Gosh, no. No way.

00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:54.615
What if the secret pact is not even there?

00:42:58.185 --> 00:42:59.185
No, hold on.

00:42:59.825 --> 00:43:00.855
No, that is not it.

00:43:01.525 --> 00:43:02.525
Park Dal.

00:43:02.885 --> 00:43:05.054
Since when were you so cautious?

00:43:05.055 --> 00:43:06.725
A merchant without guts is dead.

00:43:07.265 --> 00:43:09.265
Trust me. Trust His Highness.

00:43:10.295 --> 00:43:11.365
We charge head-on!

00:43:13.735 --> 00:43:15.204
If what Deok Chun said is true,

00:43:15.205 --> 00:43:17.905
the secret pact must be with Queen Jangjeong.

00:43:18.705 --> 00:43:20.704
I will request reinforcements...

00:43:20.705 --> 00:43:22.645
- from the Capital Garrison Command. - No, you cannot.

00:43:23.045 --> 00:43:24.374
If soldiers swarm the place,

00:43:24.375 --> 00:43:26.745
we cannot ensure Queen Jangjeong's safety.

00:43:27.285 --> 00:43:29.245
Rescuing Her Highness must be our first priority.

00:43:30.815 --> 00:43:31.815
Your Highness, the Crown Princess.

00:43:33.155 --> 00:43:34.155
Thank you.

00:43:35.525 --> 00:43:37.955
I am the one who should thank you for your restraint.

00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:40.625
And...

00:43:41.565 --> 00:43:43.695
I am afraid I have another difficult favor to ask.

00:43:45.065 --> 00:43:46.365
Once we find the secret pact,

00:43:46.535 --> 00:43:49.535
can you take it straight to Hanyang?

00:43:50.105 --> 00:43:51.975
I cannot leave my mother behind.

00:43:52.105 --> 00:43:54.945
Someone has to get the secret pact to His Royal Highness.

00:43:56.005 --> 00:43:58.575
Trust me and leave Her Majesty to me.

00:44:02.645 --> 00:44:03.655
Okay.

00:44:05.155 --> 00:44:07.324
Lord Shin Won, after rescuing Her Majesty,

00:44:07.325 --> 00:44:09.355
get reinforcements from the Capital Garrison Command.

00:44:09.625 --> 00:44:11.055
I will escort the Grand Prince's mother...

00:44:11.095 --> 00:44:13.795
to the Mount Bulgok cabin where we hid before.

00:44:14.565 --> 00:44:16.225
After you and your soldiers raid the fortress,

00:44:16.565 --> 00:44:18.295
we will meet back at Mount Bulgok.

00:44:18.465 --> 00:44:21.365
It is too risky for you to go alone. Let me escort you.

00:44:21.565 --> 00:44:23.604
I am a wanted traitor. It is more risky for me...

00:44:23.605 --> 00:44:24.735
to go to the Capital Garrison Command with you.

00:44:25.235 --> 00:44:27.445
We will use the ferry dock, so do not worry.

00:44:27.805 --> 00:44:29.075
Are you sure you will be all right?

00:44:29.445 --> 00:44:32.315
You will need more people to leave the ferry dock quickly.

00:44:37.785 --> 00:44:40.255
- What are you guys doing here? - You impossible girl!

00:44:41.255 --> 00:44:44.195
Who told you to get involved? Who asked you to rescue us?

00:44:44.525 --> 00:44:47.595
You are going to be the death of me! I swear!

00:44:49.325 --> 00:44:50.335
Wait...

00:44:51.165 --> 00:44:52.895
- How did you even find this place? - How else?

00:44:53.235 --> 00:44:55.105
We forced it out of my round-faced junior eunuch.

00:44:55.765 --> 00:44:58.905
And honey, you should speak straight.

00:44:59.175 --> 00:45:01.875
Dal is the reason we got to live extra five years and seven days.

00:45:01.945 --> 00:45:02.945
For goodness' sake.

00:45:03.675 --> 00:45:05.745
Talk about a textbook case of ingratitude.

00:45:06.075 --> 00:45:09.815
It is like saving a drowning person and then they ask why you bothered.

00:45:10.655 --> 00:45:11.655
What has gotten into her?

00:45:12.385 --> 00:45:13.385
One moment.

00:45:14.325 --> 00:45:15.885
Let us speak privately.

00:45:16.755 --> 00:45:17.755
Alone.

00:45:25.335 --> 00:45:26.365
What happened?

00:45:28.635 --> 00:45:32.405
- It is just as it looks. - Do not tell me you switched again.

00:45:32.675 --> 00:45:35.275
I did it on purpose. I wanted her safe in the palace.

00:45:35.375 --> 00:45:38.115
You mean you can switch bodies at will?

00:45:38.715 --> 00:45:39.715
It would seem so.

00:45:40.385 --> 00:45:41.385
Then...

00:45:42.245 --> 00:45:43.915
you must switch back with Her Highness now.

00:45:44.855 --> 00:45:46.655
We will take care of Her Highness.

00:45:47.585 --> 00:45:49.385
That is not something I can do on my own.

00:45:50.155 --> 00:45:53.565
Besides, even if I could, I would not.

00:45:54.095 --> 00:45:56.165
This revenge is for both me...

00:45:57.035 --> 00:45:58.165
and for Dal.

00:46:01.535 --> 00:46:02.965
And Her Highness? Does she feel the same way?

00:46:07.645 --> 00:46:08.645
In that case,

00:46:11.315 --> 00:46:12.615
I will help you.

00:46:15.415 --> 00:46:16.785
I will do whatever it takes.

00:46:49.715 --> 00:46:52.215
I am finished. You may clear the table.

00:46:52.615 --> 00:46:54.455
- Yes, Your Royal Highness. - Yes, Your Royal Highness.

00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:59.295
Here, allow me. I will take care of this.

00:47:00.165 --> 00:47:01.165
All right.

00:47:44.875 --> 00:47:46.205
I need to see the Crown Princess Consort.

00:47:46.775 --> 00:47:48.245
Prepare a eunuch's uniform for me.

00:48:11.865 --> 00:48:15.205
Thank you for your hard work. His Highness is already asleep.

00:48:15.635 --> 00:48:17.105
So why do you not have some of this while you work?

00:48:17.475 --> 00:48:21.175
- Go on, have a taste. - Much appreciated.

00:48:26.415 --> 00:48:28.415
Try this too.

00:48:35.855 --> 00:48:36.855
Halt!

00:48:38.655 --> 00:48:39.655
What is this?

00:48:41.865 --> 00:48:45.495
Oh, right. It is just some liquor.

00:48:46.035 --> 00:48:47.035
I will have to check it.

00:48:55.045 --> 00:48:58.315
Put wet straw and chili powder in jars and have it ready.

00:48:58.375 --> 00:49:00.715
Oh my. It is really spicy, right?

00:49:00.785 --> 00:49:02.315
- Here. Wipe it with this. - Get me anesthetic powder too.

00:49:02.385 --> 00:49:04.715
That is it. There you go.

00:49:34.885 --> 00:49:35.885
Gosh!

00:49:41.025 --> 00:49:42.025
That hurts.

00:51:13.545 --> 00:51:14.685
Who are you?

00:51:25.895 --> 00:51:26.965
It is okay, little one.

00:51:28.025 --> 00:51:29.025
Do not cry.

00:51:33.835 --> 00:51:34.835
Mother.

00:51:48.245 --> 00:51:49.285
Royal Mother.

00:51:51.785 --> 00:51:53.215
Your son is here.

00:51:54.585 --> 00:51:56.085
It is me, Un. I am here.

00:52:04.265 --> 00:52:05.295
It is okay, little one.

00:52:05.995 --> 00:52:07.135
It is okay. Do not cry.

00:52:08.005 --> 00:52:09.035
Mommy is here.

00:52:10.005 --> 00:52:11.005
Please!

00:52:11.935 --> 00:52:14.775
- My baby! - Mother! Please!

00:52:17.015 --> 00:52:20.275
Please look at me. Not at that pillow!

00:52:25.155 --> 00:52:27.055
I am your son.

00:52:34.465 --> 00:52:35.465
These eyes,

00:52:37.165 --> 00:52:38.165
this nose,

00:52:38.935 --> 00:52:39.935
these lips.

00:52:41.265 --> 00:52:43.835
From head to toe,

00:52:45.335 --> 00:52:47.375
everything was a gift from you, Royal Mother.

00:52:48.805 --> 00:52:50.545
I am your son.

00:53:14.765 --> 00:53:15.905
Royal Mother.

00:53:17.335 --> 00:53:18.335
Crown Prince!

00:53:28.745 --> 00:53:29.785
Is that you, Un?

00:53:34.255 --> 00:53:35.425
Is it really you, Un?

00:53:36.225 --> 00:53:38.595
Yes. It is me, Mother.

00:53:41.295 --> 00:53:42.295
My dear Un.

00:53:44.865 --> 00:53:45.865
Mother.

00:54:13.925 --> 00:54:15.525
How have you been all this time?

00:54:17.595 --> 00:54:19.195
Are you feeling all right?

00:54:20.935 --> 00:54:23.235
Your Majesty, I apologize,

00:54:23.565 --> 00:54:26.835
but did the Left State Councilor leave anything with you?

00:54:27.675 --> 00:54:28.675
Like a letter, perhaps.

00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:30.645
A letter?

00:54:36.085 --> 00:54:37.355
Forgive my intrusion.

00:54:38.015 --> 00:54:39.615
I must briefly search the room.

00:54:56.405 --> 00:54:58.035
What brings you here?

00:54:58.305 --> 00:54:59.935
I have come to discuss a difficult matter.

00:55:00.675 --> 00:55:03.575
Grand Prince Je Un has now gone to The Nameless' mountain fortress.

00:55:03.875 --> 00:55:06.575
He will probably return with his mother.

00:55:08.545 --> 00:55:09.845
When you say his mother,

00:55:10.345 --> 00:55:12.055
who are you referring to?

00:55:13.825 --> 00:55:15.155
Queen Jangjeong.

00:55:16.085 --> 00:55:17.295
Grand Prince Je Un's mother.

00:56:13.275 --> 00:56:14.285
So the Gyesa Year Incident...

00:56:14.345 --> 00:56:16.415
was revenge for the Grand Prince Un's mother?

00:56:19.115 --> 00:56:20.785
To think she was in love with my father...

00:56:23.325 --> 00:56:25.455
What a truly ridiculous pairing.

00:56:25.955 --> 00:56:27.095
It would seem...

00:56:27.325 --> 00:56:28.825
that Queen Jangjeong is...

00:56:28.895 --> 00:56:30.465
his weakness.

00:56:31.535 --> 00:56:32.635
Which is why...

00:56:32.895 --> 00:56:35.635
I think I can call off the Royal Wedding tomorrow.

00:56:37.475 --> 00:56:38.575
He will return,

00:56:39.705 --> 00:56:44.375
but if Grand Prince Je Un is not back for the Royal Wedding,

00:56:45.015 --> 00:56:47.114
I will strike the Left State Councilor...

00:56:47.115 --> 00:56:48.215
where he is most vulnerable.

00:57:08.205 --> 00:57:10.835
(The Meritorious Subjects)

00:57:14.105 --> 00:57:15.175
At last.

00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:25.315
- Please take good care of her. - Yes.

00:57:28.185 --> 00:57:29.385
Open it! Break it down!

00:57:30.285 --> 00:57:31.495
Open it!

00:57:34.025 --> 00:57:35.925
Hurry, people are coming!

00:58:48.405 --> 00:58:50.135
- Go! - Yes, sir!

00:59:01.985 --> 00:59:03.415
Mother, are you all right?

00:59:07.585 --> 00:59:09.985
- It is the traitors! - They went that way!

00:59:10.895 --> 00:59:13.655
Your Highness, please escort her to the ferry dock.

00:59:15.165 --> 00:59:17.265
Mother, I will be right behind you.

00:59:18.435 --> 00:59:19.535
This is a secret,

00:59:19.795 --> 00:59:21.605
but your son is quite the master fighter.

00:59:22.235 --> 00:59:23.305
- No, you cannot. - Over there!

00:59:23.365 --> 00:59:24.735
How can I possibly go alone?

00:59:25.075 --> 00:59:27.235
I entrust the Royal Mother to you, Your Highness,

00:59:27.335 --> 00:59:28.545
You must go, Your Majesty.

00:59:29.105 --> 00:59:30.105
Your Majesty.

00:59:38.355 --> 00:59:40.485
Get them! Do not let them get away!

00:59:46.195 --> 00:59:47.595
Just so you know, I am furious.

00:59:48.525 --> 00:59:49.995
You should be worried about saving your own neck.

01:00:48.455 --> 01:00:49.555
This way, please.

01:00:56.165 --> 01:00:57.895
- Find them! - Yes, sir.

01:00:57.965 --> 01:00:59.765
I will draw them away. You go on ahead.

01:01:00.335 --> 01:01:01.835
It is too dangerous for a woman to deal with them alone.

01:01:02.635 --> 01:01:04.835
Technically speaking, I am not really a woman.

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.304
If you go a bit further,

01:01:08.305 --> 01:01:10.075
you will find a man and two women at the ferry dock.

01:01:11.045 --> 01:01:12.745
They will help you, Your Majesty.

01:01:13.775 --> 01:01:16.385
- But how can I leave you? - Think only of your son.

01:01:17.485 --> 01:01:19.155
You must not get caught,

01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:21.855
and you cannot lose your mind. Do you understand?

01:01:42.505 --> 01:01:43.545
There she is!

01:01:44.815 --> 01:01:45.815
Get her!

01:01:53.185 --> 01:01:54.955
My dear Un...

01:02:04.565 --> 01:02:06.794
- That way! - That way! Get them!

01:02:06.795 --> 01:02:07.935
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

01:02:09.235 --> 01:02:10.235
Another unit's soldiers?

01:02:12.835 --> 01:02:14.345
There he is! Get him!

01:02:15.945 --> 01:02:18.745
They are the Royal Guards. His Majesty must have sent them.

01:02:24.415 --> 01:02:25.455
Attack!

01:02:32.395 --> 01:02:34.424
We apologize. We got lost on a mountain path...

01:02:34.425 --> 01:02:36.465
- and got held up. - It is all right.

01:02:37.495 --> 01:02:40.265
Go to the Capital Garrison Command and bring back reinforcements.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:41.965
Are we not going to the mountain fortress?

01:02:42.165 --> 01:02:45.105
We are outnumbered by The Nameless at the mountain fortress.

01:02:45.335 --> 01:02:48.105
And you, go to the Royal Mother at Bulguksa.

01:02:48.275 --> 01:02:50.905
I will go to Hanyang and give my brother the secret pact.

01:02:52.175 --> 01:02:53.515
I will go with you.

01:02:54.245 --> 01:02:55.245
You?

01:02:55.385 --> 01:02:57.014
We do not know how many men from The Nameless are...

01:02:57.015 --> 01:02:58.685
in Hanyang or on the road.

01:02:58.915 --> 01:03:01.355
If I go with you, we can avoid being spotted by The Nameless.

01:03:03.485 --> 01:03:04.495
Let us go.

01:03:09.195 --> 01:03:10.195
Let us get going.

01:03:22.605 --> 01:03:25.745
Tomorrow, in front of the ministers and all your subjects,

01:03:26.175 --> 01:03:28.145
if you reveal the truth about the secret pact,

01:03:28.985 --> 01:03:30.045
Your Majesty..

01:03:30.445 --> 01:03:32.115
Will be seen as staging a coup without just cause,

01:03:32.515 --> 01:03:33.985
and you will suffer the consequences.

01:03:34.525 --> 01:03:36.455
Furthermore, His Highness...

01:03:36.585 --> 01:03:39.825
will not be able to escape guilt by association.

01:03:40.355 --> 01:03:42.995
If all we do is worry, we will never change anything.

01:03:45.235 --> 01:03:46.665
The best option is already off the table.

01:03:47.965 --> 01:03:49.235
All that is left is the lesser of two evils.

01:04:14.295 --> 01:04:15.465
When you said strike...

01:04:15.965 --> 01:04:17.295
During the Royal Wedding procession,

01:04:17.765 --> 01:04:19.135
I will claim I sent troops...

01:04:19.665 --> 01:04:22.005
to Mount Gamak to save Queen Jangjeong.

01:04:22.105 --> 01:04:24.005
My father will not stand for that.

01:04:24.975 --> 01:04:26.604
We do not even know if Grand Prince Je Un is alive.

01:04:26.605 --> 01:04:27.775
Exactly.

01:04:29.475 --> 01:04:32.215
The Left State Councilor will rush to Queen Jangjeong's side,

01:04:32.345 --> 01:04:34.885
and that is when we can go after him with the Royal Guards.

01:04:35.185 --> 01:04:36.285
Come with me then.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:42.485
Are you worried about me?

01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:44.555
We are a team now, are we not?

01:04:45.525 --> 01:04:47.195
That is what teammates do. They help each other.

01:04:47.795 --> 01:04:49.895
If the Left State Councilor falls, you will be arrested too,

01:04:50.325 --> 01:04:51.465
and I cannot let that happen.

01:04:53.335 --> 01:04:54.905
If, by some slim chance, this goes wrong,

01:04:56.505 --> 01:04:58.035
you must go to Grand Prince Je Un anyway.

01:05:00.905 --> 01:05:02.304
I will confess to the Sinjusa incident...

01:05:02.305 --> 01:05:04.045
to tie my father's hands,

01:05:05.945 --> 01:05:07.515
so go and save Grand Prince Je Un.

01:05:09.245 --> 01:05:11.285
My father was the one who shattered me.

01:05:12.055 --> 01:05:13.315
I have no choice but to pierce him...

01:05:14.255 --> 01:05:15.985
with these shattered pieces of me.

01:05:20.055 --> 01:05:21.095
He will come.

01:05:21.795 --> 01:05:24.695
He said he would, so he will.

01:05:25.595 --> 01:05:26.735
And if he does not,

01:05:27.535 --> 01:05:28.635
I will just go to him.

01:06:39.435 --> 01:06:41.775
The daughter of Left State Councilor Kim Han Chul...

01:06:42.575 --> 01:06:44.515
is hereby appointed Crown Princess.

01:08:25.775 --> 01:08:28.515
Your Highness, you may alight now.

01:08:29.815 --> 01:08:32.315
Oh, okay.

01:10:23.565 --> 01:10:25.065
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

01:10:25.135 --> 01:10:26.565
- Oh, my. Are you all right? - Your Highness.

01:10:26.635 --> 01:10:27.635
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

01:10:28.205 --> 01:10:29.665
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

01:10:29.865 --> 01:10:31.434
- What is going on? - Your Highness.

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:33.305
- Call the Royal Physician! - Okay!

01:10:33.735 --> 01:10:36.445
- Your Highness. - Your Highness, not again.

01:10:36.505 --> 01:10:38.545
- Fetch the Royal Physician! - Yes, sir.

01:10:39.045 --> 01:10:40.115
Open the door.

01:10:49.525 --> 01:10:50.825
Remove this headdress.

01:10:51.225 --> 01:10:53.025
- Your Highness? - Now.

01:10:54.095 --> 01:10:55.095
Yes, Your Highness.

01:10:57.425 --> 01:10:59.235
If, by some slim chance, this goes wrong,

01:11:00.235 --> 01:11:01.564
I will confess to the Sinjusa incident...

01:11:01.565 --> 01:11:03.435
to tie my father's hands,

01:11:04.465 --> 01:11:05.935
so go and save Grand Prince Je Un.

01:11:07.875 --> 01:11:09.805
I must put an end to this charade.

01:11:11.815 --> 01:11:13.375
Summon the Royal Physician!

01:11:14.315 --> 01:11:16.985
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

01:11:17.145 --> 01:11:19.455
Gang!

01:11:20.285 --> 01:11:21.355
Summon the Royal Physician!

01:11:22.225 --> 01:11:23.425
Get the Royal Physician!

01:11:36.535 --> 01:11:37.535
Gang.

01:11:40.775 --> 01:11:42.705
Your Highness, are you all right?

01:11:43.245 --> 01:11:44.375
Are you all right?

01:12:34.655 --> 01:12:35.825
You must go now.

01:12:57.545 --> 01:12:58.815
The mountain fortress is surrounded.

01:12:59.155 --> 01:13:01.215
- Find their leader! - Yes, sir!

01:13:12.995 --> 01:13:14.095
Your Majesty!

01:13:16.665 --> 01:13:18.505
The killer of the former King, the Crown Prince,

01:13:19.275 --> 01:13:20.875
as well as the Queen Dowager in the Gyesa Year,

01:13:22.805 --> 01:13:24.975
is the traitor Kim Han Chul. Please order his arrest!

01:13:39.755 --> 01:13:41.125
What in the world?

01:13:59.315 --> 01:14:04.245
(Moon River)

01:14:19.365 --> 01:14:21.064
Arrest the traitor!

01:14:21.065 --> 01:14:22.965
Left State Councilor, your era is over!

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:25.635
Did you see Dal at the mountain fortress?

01:14:25.835 --> 01:14:27.405
There was no one inside her quarters.

01:14:27.735 --> 01:14:31.505
Withdraw for now. My plan will not be your undoing.

01:14:31.715 --> 01:14:32.814
Let us go.

01:14:32.815 --> 01:14:34.675
The Left Councilor has broken through the Souimun Gate.

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:36.985
There is no time. I have to find Dal.

01:14:37.345 --> 01:14:40.555
Do you intend to go down with me?

01:14:52.395 --> 01:14:53.395
What was that?

01:14:56.235 --> 01:14:57.565
We are leaving through the back gate.

01:14:58.105 --> 01:14:59.335
What?

01:15:13.055 --> 01:15:17.155
