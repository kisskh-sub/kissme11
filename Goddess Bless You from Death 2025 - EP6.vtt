00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.451
Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.320
Lab results are out.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.216
The hair in the Tukkata Siakaban.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.320
DNA doesn't match any victim or relative.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.936
There's a talisman sheet stuck here.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.160
There has to be a Tukkata Siakaban.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.936
This damn ghost.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.136
Doesn't want us to find
the Tukkata Siakaban.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.536
From the link between
these three victims.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.696
We should be looking into this place.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.000
Santi Tham House.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.960
What's this part?

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.640
An old pottery shed of
Ta Khuean and the former master.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.976
Monthut Boonkingklai.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.376
Or Ta Khuean.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.800
Our current prime suspect.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.456
Everyone who visits Santi Tham House.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.000
Will know Ta Khuean.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.216
He's the one handling the accounts.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.560
And finances of Santi Tham House.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.600
And this is Aisoon.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.800
The master.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.480
He's sick right now.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.480
After he fell ill.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.360
Ta Khuean seems to hold
more power in the house.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.640
So that means...

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.816
Every murder case.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.720
Has something to do with money.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.360
The power of money is terrifying.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.600
Still not certain yet.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.080
Need to dig further.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.080
But with the evidence we have now.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.800
Everything points to several victims.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.880
Being linked to Santi Tham House.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.560
Mek.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.160
Go look deeper into Ta Khuean.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.600
Got it.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.840
Take the soil for testing.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.280
See if it matches the doll we have.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.520
Okay.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.080
Any issues, Inspector?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.560
As discussed.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.080
I've got no concerns.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.480
Got the item.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.400
Proceed.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.880
Yes, Inspector.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.760
- All done.
- Thanks.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.080
Buying this much…

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.520
You really don't want me keeping fit.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.120
You won't get fat.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.280
Still plenty of room to get fat.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.280
If you want anything else.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.720
Tell me.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.240
You're acting oddly sweet.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.120
Something wrong?

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680
I just want to take care of you.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.760
Is that not allowed?

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.080
Why be nice to me now?

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.680
I'm just sick.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.680
Not dying.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.800
Did a ghost jump into you?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.200
Where's…

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.200
The protective shell I gave you.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.560
You still carrying it?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.800
I'm fine.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.320
And I didn't throw your
protective shelll away.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.080
I keep it in my bag.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.760
Okay?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.880
When you weren't conscious.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.840
I was terrified.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.080
I was afraid.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.560
I wouldn't get the chance
to apologise to you.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.960
For what I said that day.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.920
When you woke up.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.320
I promised myself that.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.200
I want to come back
and make us clear again.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.160
I want to be the one
who takes care of you.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.280
I don't want anything
to happen to you again.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.800
And you think…

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.120
We could work out?

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.360
It won't end the same way?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.080
I tried opening up to someone new.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.280
But I always ended up back with you.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.120
I think…

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.200
It's no different from…

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.520
Ending the same way, just like you said.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.640
If that's how it has to be.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.560
I'd rather choose starting over with you.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.680
Whatever you say, I say the same.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.520
I don't want to lose you to anyone either.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.920
Really?

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.600
I'm still sore.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.280
Let me postpone the hug.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.960
Hug gently, okay?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.120
Mm.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.280
And stop talking to that guy.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.880
I'm jealous.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.240
But…

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.520
He is kind of cute.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.680
You're asking for it.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.000
Kidding.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.120
Come on, let's eat.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.080
Here.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.000
Look.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.680
There's rice too.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.480
Here.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.560
You don't eat bamboo shoots, right?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.600
I got this from Santi Tham House.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.080
Thup asked for it at the charity kitchen.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.880
Santi Tham House.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.256
The one from the Seven-Tree case.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.360
Yeah.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.679
Why?

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:42.736
Hey.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.039
Get your laptop.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.320
What are you looking for?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.080
The bamboo shoots you brought.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.800
Bamboo shoots.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.960
What about them?

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.360
I remember the body we examined…

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.920
Had bamboo shoots in the stomach.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.880
Let me check.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.320
Shit.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.120
It's really there.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.800
Another one.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.760
Every victim.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.800
Had bamboo shoots in the stomach.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.200
P'Sing.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.176
I just found out every body…

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.920
Had bamboo shoots in the stomach.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.880
(Special Investigation Division)

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.976
Here, Inspector.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.296
The Tukkata Siakaban we collected
from the scene and the victims' homes.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.760
Arranged from Sunday to Saturday.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.216
Just collecting evidence took this long?

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.920
Didn't you split the teams?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.400
Anything holding you back?

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.560
Not exactly, sir.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.856
We ran into something strange.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.600
While we were collecting evidence.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.240
Like at Orn's house.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.776
Officers went in and a big branch
fell on them.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.160
They had to go to the hospital.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.976
And at Jom's house on Monday.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Officers collecting evidence got
sideswiped by a car.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.480
And the other two houses.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.520
Every officer said the same thing.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.176
Ghosts again, Sergeant?

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.456
Give me something rational, please.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.000
Inspector King, I want
it to be rational too.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.056
But from what I saw

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.520
I'm sure it was a ghost too.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.760
Okay, okay, ghosts later.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.376
What about the soil results?

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.520
From the soil on the Tukkata Siakaban…

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.376
And soil from Santi Tham House…

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.600
They're the same type.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.640
Remember the food Sey took home yesterday?

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.936
Sey and Darin got curious.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.600
They looked through each autopsy report.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.440
Turns out the food inside each victim…

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.520
Was the same type.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.640
Likely from the same place.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.920
The charity kitchen, right?

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.000
Then we can drop the other details.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.520
And focus on Santi Tham House.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.000
We're getting closer to the culprit.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.840
I'll dig more into Ta Khuean too.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.440
- Help me store the evidence.
- Yes, sir.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.560
(Evidence Storage Room)

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.400
Get to the evidence room now.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.920
Don't come in.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.280
P'Singha.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.080
Who did you assign to store
the Tukkata Siakaban?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.760
P'Khem.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.120
P'Khem! P'Khem!

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.856
P'Khem! P'Khem!

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.336
P'Khem! P'Khem!

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.400
P'Khem!

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.200
Call an ambulance!

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.640
Mek!

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760
Yes!

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.320
Come on, get up!

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.976
Sergeant Khem said…

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.680
A ghost tricked him.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.376
It whispered in his ear…

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.200
Telling him to eat the dolls.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.240
To leave none behind.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.120
What the hell…

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.960
Is this another ritual?

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.520
Doesn't seem like it.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.880
The ghost that attacked him…

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.240
Probably just wanted
to destroy evidence.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.000
If what you're saying is true…

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.840
Then the ghost intends to kill everyone…

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.160
Who touches the evidence.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.480
I think…

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.000
P'Singha should keep
all the dolls with you.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.360
You're the only one
the ghost won't go near.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.640
Singha.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.120
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.840
Ghosts aren't real.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.080
I know.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.440
It sounds unbelievable.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.760
But if we try what Thup said…

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.200
It won't hurt, right?

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.800
If you take the evidence home…

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.320
And Thup really is the culprit…

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.440
And he messes with the evidence…

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.080
What will you do?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.920
I'll take responsibility.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.160
Satisfied?

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.280
I told you to do this…

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.040
So the deity protects us both.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.336
We just pray regularly…

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.680
And make offerings. That's enough.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.320
Mm.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.800
And this…

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.400
Is yours.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.080
You want me to wear it?

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.000
Yeah.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.000
It'll keep you safe from danger.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.800
Or wear it as fashion if you want.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.200
Looks nice.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.240
What if I just carry it instead?

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.920
Fine.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.000
Here.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.760
Put it on me?

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.040
What about the offering fee?

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.880
Things like this don't come free.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.360
He's strict about it.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.440
Can I pay with this instead?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.160
(Special Investigation Division)

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.376
You did what I said
and went against Inspector King…

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.680
Will you be okay?

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.040
It's fine.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.456
I think this is better.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.120
After seeing Sergeant Khem like that…

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.480
No one will dare touch these dolls.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.840
Thanks for trusting me.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.160
Hey…

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.400
Bringing them to your place…

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.960
You'll be okay, right?

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.400
You won't get dragged into it?

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.680
You're worried about me?

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.240
You

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.440
I have to worry about everyone.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.560
I'll be fine.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.080
Your house has Thao Wessuwan.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.120
As long as I'm inside your house…

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.320
Then I'll definitely be safe.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.480
So my place is your shelter for now.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.200
Until we close this case.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.840
Meaning when it's closed…

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.760
You'll kick me out?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.040
Why?

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.280
You like pitching a tent in my house?

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.560
And if I say yes?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.800
Will you let me stay?

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.440
We'll see after we close the case.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.800
Go shower.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.400
We've got an early morning.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.640
Go.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.680
P'Sing, this is the house.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.976
Damn.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.816
This land must cost a lot.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.040
Wonder if he skimmed donation money.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.480
Got more info?

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.216
Uh…

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.400
Ta Khuean used to be a cop in Sisaket
twenty years ago.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.776
Then transferred to Bangkok for good.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.456
Seems he brought a case with him.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.680
He once got drunk and attacked
his wife and kid.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.240
And where's his family now?

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.360
Both passed away.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.640
Cause of death?

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.680
Not in the file.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.800
Maybe illness or an accident.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.056
If it were homicide…

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.600
There would've been a case file,
but there's nothing.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.960
Okay.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.680
Let's ask around.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.920
Auntie.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.576
That house next to the rental lot,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.920
Whose place is it?

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.296
Oh, that's Ta Khuean's house.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.880
He always buys dog food
and cat food here.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.496
He's lived here long?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.176
Over ten years now.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.056
He moved down from Isan.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.296
Then stayed at Santi Tham House.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.560
Didn't take long…

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.800
Before he was driving a Benz.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.280
I just feel bad for Than Aiyasoon.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.400
Didn't he know?

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.096
Whenever he went to Santi Tham House,

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.120
he'd park somewhere around here

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.680
and walk in.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.376
And Ta Khuean's house,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.296
There are always people stopping by.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.240
And it's not just one or two people.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.480
And here,

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.576
They always wash their cars back here,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.600
then drink till they're drunk.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.576
Than Aiyasoon is truly respectable.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.320
But Ta Khuean…

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.080
- How much?
- Thirty baht.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.720
Did you see the documents I sent, sir?

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.600
Right now Inspector Singha

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.200
is fully focused on Santi Tham House.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.760
But I found something interesting,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.136
thought you should know.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.680
Ta Khuean, who manages Santi Tham House,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.480
came from Sisaket.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.080
Same province as him?

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.160
I already told Sey

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.576
I could come by myself.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.200
No need to drag you and Thup along.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.600
You're my brother.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.200
Sey's tied up, so I came instead.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.520
Stop acting tough.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.200
I know you're pleased

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.680
that Sey was worried.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.920
What are you talking about?

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.600
I just don't wanna bother you guys.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.120
If you didn't want to bother me,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.800
you wouldn't be out working like this.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.400
Take care of yourself too.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.320
It's rare to find a lead this solid,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.800
how could I just ignore it?

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.400
Give it here. I'll handle it.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.896
Appointment request, sir.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.640
For Darin.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.360
Ji jaruni jittang

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.120
jetasikang rupang nibbanang.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.160
Do I need to sign? Where?

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.120
I took seven.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.680
So I'll take seven more.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.280
Yak.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.080
Thup.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.320
Thup.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.560
Thup.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:31.960
Put this on, Thup.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.800
What happened?

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.080
Thank you so much.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.560
You can keep it on for now.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.320
It's okay.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.680
There's no god out there who can help me.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.520
Except P'Singha.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.920
You've been seeing ghosts a lot lately.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.680
Not just ghosts, sir.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.960
I ran into some YouTubers too.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.800
Huh?

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.960
Doing what?

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.800
I have no idea either.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.880
But the ghost told me,

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.520
it ate seven already.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.040
And it'll eat seven more.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.400
What's that mean?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.760
What else would it mean?

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.040
It already sacrificed seven bodies.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.880
Next it's going to sacrifice seven more.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.160
That's terrifying.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.256
Tejo-dhatu.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.080
- P'Singha, look at this.
- Jump?

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.856
Jump?

(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.960
Hey!

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.480
What are you two doing here?

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.616
Hello, officers.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.736
Jump's acting weird so,

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.680
I brought him to the hospital.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.296
It's okay, man. You're fine.

kasajapha - It's okay.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.280
P'Singha…

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.440
It's a ghost-calling chant.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.560
A ghost-calling chant?

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.096
Jump,

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.136
stop chanting right now, man!

Jump, stop chanting!

Jump.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.240
I prayed for P'Sey and P'Darin, sir.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.456
Asked the deity to ward off evil for them.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.960
And you didn't pray for yourself?

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.440
I have you.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.256
And you never think,

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.600
that maybe I want protection too?

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.360
The deity protects you already, sir.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.680
I can feel it.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.400
He's always with you.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.800
Singha,

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.600
here, child.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.440
I invited the deity to protect you.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.600
You okay?

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.680
Oh, I'm fine.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.600
Yeah.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.776
What that spirit said to you,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.400
what was it trying to tell you?

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.496
Darin said another round of
seven sacrifices might happen.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.800
Is that even possible?

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.160
I'm not too sure either.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.056
But something might've gone wrong,

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.240
and now they need seven more victims.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.160
I'll ask people back home in Sisaket.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.080
Someone might know about the ritual.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.280
I'll leave it to you then.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.800
You're my spiritual consultant, after all.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.600
Okay.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.560
Thanks, man.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.560
Without you,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.280
I'd be falling apart already.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.960
Every time we split up,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.840
you end up running into something weird.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.160
I'll go report to the director.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.200
I'm not going to that seminar anymore.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.280
You?

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.496
Defy the director's order?

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:42.800
No way.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.560
Why?

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.800
You don't want me around?

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.680
It's not that.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.776
I just…

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.120
Feel like,

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.560
it's nice.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.680
Us being like this right now.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.760
But I just.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.840
I'm scared it won't last.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.720
You overthink too much.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.920
Worrying about things before they happen.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.120
Right now,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.320
I'm here with you.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.200
And we're both happy.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.800
Isn't that enough?

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.200
Thup, come here.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.480
Thup.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.560
Follow me.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.800
Thup.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.480
Thup.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.200
Thup.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.080
Thup.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.680
Follow me.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.440
Thup.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.440
Follow me.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.280
Maysa.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.240
So? Can you do it?

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.000
Good job.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.160
Maysa.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.880
Maysa.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.040
Maysa.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.920
Where are you going? Homework first.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.800
Maysa.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.080
Thup.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.056
Thup.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.600
Come here.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.080
Thup.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.240
- Thup.
- Thup.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.376
Follow me.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.520
Thup.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.760
Thup, do you realize what you're doing?

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.400
Thup, don't go.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.296
Thup, come back.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.440
Come back.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.000
Come back.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.080
Come back, come back!

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.760
P'Singha.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.320
I'm right here.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.040
Why didn't you answer me?

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.920
I didn't hear you at all.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.440
I only heard a voice telling me to go out.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.480
Who told you to sleep on the floor?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.320
Get up here.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.880
I mean I'll share half the bed with you.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.520
But if you keep messing with me,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.000
stay right there.

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.760
Thup.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.680
Stop fidgeting.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.600
Sorry.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.840
Is the reason you're not sleeping… me?

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.400
No.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.960
Are you afraid I'll disappear?

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.600
When you walked out of the house,

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.120
my heart dropped.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.280
It reminded me of that day.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.440
What happened to Maysa.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.160
My little sister.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.840
You can tell me about it.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.880
I understand.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.080
It must've been really hard for you.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.720
So…

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.200
When you're ready to tell it,

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.040
you can tell me then.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.960
I'll be right here waiting.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.680
Thanks.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.280
Easy.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Right now you're my witness.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.960
Let that end first,

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:53.320
then we talk.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.960
Then…

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.280
You don't have to do anything.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.440
But I can do things for you, right?

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.920
Thup.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.440
Aren't you cold?

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.320
What now?

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.016
Last night you said you were cold,

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.480
and then you curled into me.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.320
Look, my arm's still numb.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.400
What?

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.976
You're the one,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.560
who pulled me in first.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.120
I followed your rules exactly.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.200
I'm just a witness.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.920
I'm taking a shower.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.040
If the inspector wants me,

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.960
you better catch the culprit fast.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.320
Thup.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.240
What are you doing?

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.600
Loosening soil.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.200
I ordered porridge for you.
It's on the table.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.456
Here.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.000
Besides being my spiritual advisor,

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.160
you're a gardener too, huh?

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.200
So, you like it?

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:41.960
Like what?

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.000
Such a show-off.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.136
But last night,

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.680
you looked like you liked it.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.360
Thup.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.320
Sleep on the floor tonight, I swear.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.520
What?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.440
Go do it.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.680
Why are you here?

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.240
Thamawat Santasakol.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.840
You're under arrest for murder,

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.680
with intent.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.680
So this is how you want it?

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.080
It's a court warrant.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.680
Right now Ta Khuean

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.496
is a suspect in a major case.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.776
From what we know of him,

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.680
He's a good-hearted man.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.920
And didn't you say this
happens every five years?

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.840
It hasn't even been that long.
Why again?

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.280
The body we found,

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.840
was disturbed.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.736
Meaning,

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.096
someone born on Sunday

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.696
will have to be killed again.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.400
I don't know what your sister faced,

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.536
but I won't let myself die too.

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.656
And I,

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.720
won't ever leave you either.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.240
P'Sing, move closer to Thup a bit?

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.080
(Being pulled this close is embarrassing.)

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.376
(What is with these two?)

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.440
(I'm not okay with this.)

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.280
What happened to you?

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.280
Got… hit by a car.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.136
But no one came to check on me.
(No one cared at all?)

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.456
I want to look after you. Is that not
allowed? (Thought no one cared?)

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:18.856
(Don't come making my heart waver again.)

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.680
And staying here at the
house, you're okay with it?

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.240
You're worried about me?
