found someone

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.920
whom I can live
the rest of my life with.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.560
Mr. Shen. Mrs. Shen.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.439

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.959
Xiao Huaijin is watching things closely

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.790
and Li Wan'er is constantly
making underhanded moves.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.390
If I want to overturn
the Shen family's case,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.399
the first thing to do

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.399
is to hit their morale.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.790
His Majesty is organizing
a banquet in the palace.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.639
He invited both of us.

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:15.040
This must be a scheme

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.240
of Xiao Huaijin and Li Wan'er.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.240
How amazing.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.920
All of your fathers, brothers,

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.399
and husbands

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.560
are a pillar of Liang.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.800
I offer a toast to everyone

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.480
on behalf of Father.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.399
Thank you for the wine.
Your Majesty and Your Highness.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.160
I found you the man you wanted.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.360
He has been visiting various brothels
for a few years.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.800
He is handsome, fit,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.000
and riddled with filthy diseases.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.759
If you send the wretch to his room,

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.560
he'll know what to do.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.560
Have you

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920
carried out your task?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.600
The Governor's Residence

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.759
isn't impenetrable.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.120
It depends on how much
you are willing to pay.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.279
I've swapped

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:22.439
Shen Yunqi with someone else.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.920
This time,

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:26.959
Pei Yu and Xi Yan
will be utterly humiliated

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.279
even if they don't die.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.160
Since she's not lowly enough,

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:34.000
I will turn her

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.560
into the filthiest piece of trash.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.360
How dare she look down on me?

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.079
I'll show her

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.199
how filthy she is.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.839
All of you always say

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.000
that I

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.879
am the emperor and also a father.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.319
Today, I organized this family banquet

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.360
to enjoy

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:14.319
with all of you.

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.319
Your Majesty's grace covers the land

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.439
yet someone tries
to defy Your Majesty in secret.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.839
They say they serve Your Majesty loyally

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.879
yet they are going against
the imperial court behind your back.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.319
Prince Duan,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.340
do you have proof for saying this?

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.990
Our residence has been accepting
Your Majesty's grace for generations.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.199
We will never allow anyone
to lie to Your Majesty.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.279
Even if I risk getting beheaded,

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.079
I must still
accuse the Governor, Pei Yu,

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.800
of harboring the remnants of the traitors

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.079
of the Shen family's case.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.160
Prince Duan,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.720
I wonder who the remnants of the traitors
you speak of are.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.450
Your Majesty.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.040
I can prove

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.100
that the remnant harbored by Pei Yu

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:11.360
is the son of
the Shen family case's culprit,

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:14.040
the young master
of the Shen family, Shen Yunqi.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.839
Your Majesty,

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:28.759
this boy

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:31.639
is the remnant of the Shen family,
Shen Yunqi.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.639
Young Master.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.840
It really is you.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.200
Your Majesty,

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.399
he is indeed the young master
of the Shen family.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.799
Your Majesty.

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.840
I have evidence and a witness.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:56.919
I dare not

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.919
lie to Your Majesty.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.240
Pei Yu,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.600
now that it has come to this,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.799
don't you have anything else to say?

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.200
Pei Yu,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.919
are you going to kill him

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.120
in front of the emperor?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200
Xiao Huaijin,

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:14.039
you accused me in front of the emperor

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.159
by using a fake Shen Yunqi.

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:21.320
Who is the one lying to the emperor?

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.519
Your Majesty, forgive me!

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:26.130
Your Majesty, forgive me!

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:27.159
It was Prince Duan

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.600
who abducted my son

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.799
and forced me

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.039
to do this.

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:37.159
He is the Governor.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.159
I heard your son is working at
Prince Duan's Residence.

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:45.919
Think about it carefully.

00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:48.240
You won't end well

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.879
by helping him.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.720
Governor, please investigate this.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.240
Prince Duan has been forcing me.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.559
He said

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.679
if I didn't obey him,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.159
he would

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.440
kill my son.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.440
What did he ask you to do?

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.559
Tell me.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.159
I can guarantee the safety

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.000
of you and your son.

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:24.600
Your Majesty.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720
I am innocent.

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:27.720
I was also lied to
by a treacherous person

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.279
so I...

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:28.919
Shut up.

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:32.679
As a prince,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.710
you didn't investigate anything
and failed to determine good and evil.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.480
I'll punish you by confining you
in your residence.

00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:42.960
Without my order, you must not
leave Prince Duan's Residence.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.679
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.600
I will surely reflect
on my mistakes sincerely.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.080
I'm having a good time

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.919

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:29.600

You saved me from bandits.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.919
Since then, I swore
to only marry no one but you.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.279
One of these lanterns

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:07.399
used to be lit for me.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.039
But now,

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:11.159
no one

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:12.799
will light any lanterns there.

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:16.320
I will forever be

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:18.159
the noblest princess of Liang

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:20.960
and Father's most loved daughter.
