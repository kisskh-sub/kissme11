This sword is extremely sharp

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.320
yet it can also be gentle.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.359
You still need more practice.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.760
Although I don't know much
about swordsmanship,

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.079
I know a move

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.320
to repel enemies.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.708
What do you mean?

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.359
Using myself as bait
to lure the enemy into the trap.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.640
Piercing myself
while stabbing the enemy as well.

What about that?

Pei Yu!

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.959
Take care of my brother.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.190
It's all thanks to the Governor
for saving Young Master.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.400
The physician said Young Master
only suffers from a slight shock.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.560
He needs to recover slowly.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.880
What about the Governor?

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.080

But Li Wan'er sees you as an enemy.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.680
Even if she gets the herb,
she still won't give it to you.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.040
Wait for me outside.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.759
Everything Li Wan'er does

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.800
is to win Pei Yu's heart.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.839
She might not give me the herb

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:10.480
but she won't see Pei Yu die

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.399

If one can exchange
her life for another's,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.439

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.360
I don't want to save Pei Yu?

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.759
I don't object

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.680
to you killing her.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.160
But Pei Yu

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.079
is a man I love.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.959
If you hurt him today,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.439
I'll get even with you in another day.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.759

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.240
Pei Yu can sacrifice himself

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.600
just to save you.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:14.920
I'm sure you can also give everything

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.639
for his sake, right?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.480
Give me the herb.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.970
I'll give you my life.

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.480
That depends on

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.480
whether you are still alive
to get the herb.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.959
How dare you attack me?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.519

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:45.879

Pei Yu's life is in danger.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.780
I'm sure you don't want
anything to happen to him.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.720
I don't care who you are.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.879
How dare you embarrass me
time after time

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.759
and win Pei Yu's heart?

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.439
I want you to know

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:18.199
that you

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:21.160
will never win against me.

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.600
Something so minor

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.399
is not good enough.

Otherwise, how can I
make you lower your guard?

The spirits won't listen
to your prayers anymore in the future.

deliver the letter in time?
