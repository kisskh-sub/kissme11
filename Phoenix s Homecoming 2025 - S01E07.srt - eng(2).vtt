=Episode 7=

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.519
Bring me the brush.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.760
Cheng.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.808
What do you think?

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:29.120
(The Reign of Yao and Shun)

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.879
Isn't this
the Grand Princess' handwriting?

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:32.760
(It's him after all.)

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:35.159
(As my personal secretary,)

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.879
(he's skilled at imitating)

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.760
(my handwriting.)

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.799
All of you, get out.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:41.799
I want to live.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.840
I want to live.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.480
Die!

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.959
Stay back.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.239
Die!

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.480
Jia Cheng.

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.799
I have come to see you.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.719
Your Highness?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.400
Your Highness.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.199
Since ancient times,
beauties and famed generals

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.759
are not meant to show
the toll of years to mortal eyes.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.719
You are growing old here.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.199
But I have been

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.879
terribly lonely in the underworld.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.080
Jia Cheng,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.599
have you forgotten

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.680
who brought you into the palace?

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.000
How dare you betray me?

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.960
Kill him for me now.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.680
Pay for my master's death.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240
Sheng Yunlin.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.280
Are you a vengeful ghost
from the underworld?

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.400
Lord Jia killed someone!

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.840
Help!

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080
Help!

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.080
Lord Jia killed someone!

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.240
Help!

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.919
Let's go.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.759
Blood!

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.159
A body!

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.319
Why would he kill his own retainer?

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.319
Stop staring. Report to the authorities.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.560
Report it now.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.240
Report it now.

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.080
How am I

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.199
going to run my business?

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.080
Oh, my heavens!

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.152
Where is the killer?

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.719
He already vanished so soon.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.719
Search. He couldn't have gone far.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:09.800
To make them fall out,

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.120
you must corner them first.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.479
Once they fall out,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.112
the mastermind shows up.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.079
To spare a rival invites a future doom.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.000
Lure the snake, and seal its tomb.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:20.199
The Ghost Fire killed
his retainer today.

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.519
What a great show.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.560
They're after you.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.800
Our cooperation ends here.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.759
Leave.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.560
I disagree.

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:14.560
(Chancellor, Huo Chengyun)

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.480
The assassination failed.
I await punishment.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.959
The Prince of Qi
had a woman by his side.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.120
Great martial artist.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.240
She looks exactly like
the Grand Princess.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.040
(The Grand Princess?)

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:28.165
(Wedding of the New Emperor Chen Yu)

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:31.519
Yuan!

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.000
Sheng Yunlin!

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.560
Mark my words.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.360
I'll kill you with my own hands.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.040
It's His Majesty's wedding.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.959
Chancellor Huo's son, Huo Yuan,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.839
harassed me first

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.480
then attempted to murder me.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.399
To protect myself,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.279
I executed him on the spot.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.279
Should anyone object,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.040
it would be disloyalty
and disrespect toward

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:42.639
His Majesty.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.920
I failed to discipline my son.

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.439
I am guilty.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.800
I beg Your Highness for forgiveness.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.399
Really?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.319
Absolutely.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.800
It's all because of

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:13.759
that woman...

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.519
Chancellor, he mentioned
the Grand Princess.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.480
The Grand Princess

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.240
simply wouldn't let go.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.040
Is there something behind it?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.879
Recently,

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.360
several murders have occurred.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.920
Feng Yuan and Xue Ruoliu

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.560
perished in phosphorescent flames.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:56.439
Su Wei died in a fire
caused by lightning.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:58.920
All fire-related.

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:04.959
History is written by the victors.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.120
In this lifetime's chess game,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.959
I have narrowly won by half a move.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.519
But I respect an opponent like you,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.199
who made the game more satisfying.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.160
Enjoy the wine

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.439
on your way

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.040
to the underworld.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.160
It seems someone is plotting

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.879
to do the Grand Princess justice.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:43.720
Fine.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:46.919
Then I will

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:50.799
take you all down.

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:27.039
Sheng Yunlin,

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:30.720
how many lives do you think you have?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.240
Bear with it.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.159
Your medicine

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:19.720
works remarkably well.

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:23.879
Why haven't you ever shared it with me?

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:26.480
The medicine wasn't ready yet,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.480
and you were already gone.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.279
I've stirred the court

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.919
and was in grave danger

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.720
due to the schemers.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.320
I've also drawn the bow,

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:43.720
fought on battlefields,
and survived against all odds,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.159
expecting only to die
wrapped in horsehide.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.399
But I have never been

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.360
as afraid

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.399
as I am now.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.399
All this...

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.559
I was consumed by fire,
but it felt like a dream.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:08.240
When I awoke,

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.440
I was in a performance troupe.

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:13.639
The manager beat me at will.

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:15.960
Then, I tried to seek refuge

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.399
at the Chaohuang Academy,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.879
only to find everything had changed.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.679
I've been wandering around.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.759
It's only normal to have some wounds.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.200
You didn't

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.440
come find me

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:37.088
because you didn't trust me?

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:40.759
This is the path I must walk,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.639
even if it's paved with thorns,

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:47.919
even if demons block the way.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:50.600
I will tread over them all.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:54.799
Since Heaven has granted me
a second chance at life,

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:56.879
I swear I will

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.840
discover the truth on my own.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.559
How is she?

00:12:38.679 --> 00:12:39.360
She's fine.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.919
Go back and rest.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.159
Is she badly hurt?

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:50.639
If you could defend yourself,

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:51.840
she would...

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.360
I'm fine.

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:57.360
Sit.

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:58.720
We need to talk.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.584
Why did you risk your life for me?

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.600
Aren't we partners?

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:12.679
Besides,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.360
I saved the Seventeenth Prince of Qi.

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:18.399
This deal

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.559
is hardly a loss, right?

00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:25.960
My people reported that

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:29.120
the assassins were
Chancellor Huo's shadow guards.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.200
So they were after you,
Seventeenth Prince.

00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:37.559
Quite popular with assassins, huh?

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:38.159
My lady,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.799
if you want to talk about this,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.639
then I won't hide anything.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.120
Qi State faces internal strife.

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:51.000
King Liang and the Crown Prince
are locked in conflict.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.799
So, you...?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.679
I side with the Crown Prince.

00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:58.759
Otherwise, why would

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.720
King Liang's lackey,

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:03.679
Chancellor Huo, send assassins?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.519
So the traitor

00:14:12.679 --> 00:14:13.519
is him.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.200
That's right.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:18.399
Can the Chen State

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.279
truly withstand the Qi State?

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.399
Your Crown Prince advocates peace.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.159
Only King Liang

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:28.840
lusts for power and war.

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.320
Seventeenth Prince,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.720
you support the Crown Prince.

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:36.120
Surely you don't want wars, right?

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.000
Of course not.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.159
After all, my fair Grand Princess

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.960
has returned.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.799
Since you know that she's

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:48.039
the Grand Princess,

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.320
address her respectfully as

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.159
"Your Highness".

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:53.559
Hands off me.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.879
My lady, look at him.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.679
I hate schemes and court politics.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.440
I'd even marry into Chen
as Prince Consort,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.679
and never attend court.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.720
I just don't get it.

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:04.399
Some people

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.200
rejected the marriage proposal. Huh?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.399
So curious.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:12.039
I don't think you're badly injured

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:13.759
since you're so talkative.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:16.279
I could totally

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:21.440
administer some poison to the dressing
you need to change every three days.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.639
Let go.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.759
Since you treated my lady's wound,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.039
I'll tell you

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.159
what truly caused
the Chen State's defeat back then.
