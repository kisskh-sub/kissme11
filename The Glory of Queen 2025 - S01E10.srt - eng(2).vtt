[The Glory of Queen]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
[Episode 10]

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.980
Did I startle you?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.060
No.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.620
I just didn't expect that you,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.380
Eldest Young Master,
would have feelings for me.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.620
Don't belittle yourself.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.820
You've always held a special place
in my heart.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.500
Do you remember the first time we met?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.300
You were tied to a tree,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.180
and I knew right away

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.900
you were unlike any other woman.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.740
I appreciate your kind words.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.260
When I heard Grandmother wanted you
to marry into the Pei family,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.260
I was overjoyed,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.020
because I knew
my opportunity had arrived.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.340
Even if you weren't interested in me,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.660
I still had to give it a try.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.580
I haven't made up my mind
about that matter yet.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500
You wanted to leave Jingheng,
didn't you?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.660
Actually, I know it was you
who took the fragrance manual.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.580
But don't worry,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.460
I never intended to tell anyone.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.100
I just wanted you to know how I feel.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.820
No matter what,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.500
I hope you'll stay in the Pei family.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.580
Pei Jingheng has taken
the real fragrance manual,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.580
and Ergou and the others
have already been rescued.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.300
On the surface, I have no reason

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.300
to stay in the Pei family.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.140
But if I agree to him,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.740
I can naturally remain at the Pei Manor

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.780
and investigate
what happened to my aunt.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.060
Eldest Young Master.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.500
Actually,
when I told Madam I'd consider it,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.220
it wasn't because I had feelings
for either of you.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.340
I truly want to learn fragrance-making,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.580
and I need a reason

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.900
to stay at the Pei Manor
for the long term.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.980
I see.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.260
Life at the Pei Manor
is difficult for me, too.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.660
I also want someone strong to rely on.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.700
Then how about this?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.660
We enter into

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100
a contract marriage.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.380
All right.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.420
Once we are married,
I shall honor all your wishes.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.900
I'll also make sure
you are shown due respect

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.020
in public.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.540
My Lady, it is now confirmed
that Song Zhiyao

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.620
will marry into the Pei Manor.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.460
Then we'll see if she lives long enough
to marry into the Pei Manor.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.300
Then, should we

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.340
do something about it?

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.100
Don't alert them.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.300
Strike where it hurts most.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.820
I will use this opportunity

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.820
to ensure he never has a chance
to turn things around.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.900
Song Zhiyao?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.620
Are these to your liking?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.700
Eldest Young Master,
this is only a cooperative arrangement.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.940
There's truly no need
for such costly gifts.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.620
I never had

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.180
anything good growing up,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.500
nor was I ever valued.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.660
But that's all in the past now.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.980
All I want now

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.020
is a grand and dignified wedding
with you.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.140
All right, then. I'll do as you wish.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.900
The craftsman here
is the most renowned in Wu County.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.660
I specifically commissioned him
to make this set

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.060
for our wedding.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.900
You...

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.540
Are you getting married?

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.140
Second Young Master.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.460
Zhiyao, I...

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.740

What's going on?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.060
Is what Jinglan said true?

I've decided
to marry into the Pei family

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.780
and become Eldest Young Master's wife.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.580
Why?

Do you have feelings for him, too?

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.860
Eldest Young Master is kind

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.140
and good-tempered.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.100
I think he's quite nice.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.380
So, you do like him?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.540
Zhiyao,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.900
I think these earrings
go perfectly with your headpiece,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.860
so I bought them for you.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.140
Jingheng, I see you've been talking
for quite a while.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.900
Are you finished yet?

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.340
I'd like to take her

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.020

Let's go try it on,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.660
and then we can head to Baoyu Pavilion.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.860
Eldest Young Master,

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.580
I still have a few things
to attend to today.

Pei Jingheng?

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.460
Why are you here again?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.540
Are you following me?

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.060
Who's following you?

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.700
I'm here to look for clues.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.540
You actually remembered
to come here to look for clues.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.700
And what about you?

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.180
Did you find any clues?

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.820
How do you know I didn't find any clues?

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.900
I'm not you. You said you were coming
to rescue someone,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.620
and now you're about to marry Jinglan.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.780
I did come to the Pei Manor

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.340
to rescue someone.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.740
Is this really the right place
to discuss this?

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.300
Well, come with me.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.900
Do you think this counts as a new lead?

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.820
This one looks like "Ong,"

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.660
and this one is "Pei."

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.340
"Ong"… "Ing"…

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.340
It's Song Ping, my aunt.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.620
This must be the place
where she was held.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.500
Any thoughts?

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.660
Do tell.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.340
See these scratches on the wall?

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.940
The new ones layered over the old.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.340
Whoever was kept in this hidden cell

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.860
must have been imprisoned
for many years.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.020
Who do you think was imprisoned here?

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.140
Have you ever wondered about this?

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.500
Why is it that, in all of Wu County,
only the Pei family

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.580
dominates the fragrance trade?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.060
What happened to the others,

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.020
the ones talented at fragrance-making?

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.020
Did their businesses really fail,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.460
or did they go missing?

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.820
And why, of all places,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.580
does the Pei Manor just happen
to have a hidden cell like this?

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.420
I heard something over there.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.300
Let's check it out.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.900
Let's go.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.580
You're so skilled in martial arts.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.540
What are you hiding from?

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.180
Very well. I'll go and kill them now.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.580
No. Don't kill the innocent.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.380
Let's go.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.180
Let's talk.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.980
What exactly are you staying
in the Pei Manor for?

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.420
I'm staying here to rescue my friends.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.780
That was ages ago.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.100
They were rescued long since.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.340
What really matters now
is you and Jinglan...

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.580
You two…

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.140
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.740
Wasn't it you who said so?

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.940
That one must have a skill to rely on,

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.340
and can't go on stealing forever.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.660
Now I want to be a good person.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.180
I want to learn
the art of fragrance‑making.

00:10:54.181 --> 00:11:00.475
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.300
Yes.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.220
True.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.780
Then you… Do you like Jinglan?

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.100
I don't dislike him.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.140
I don't believe you.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.460
Then I don't like him,

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.860
and I like you instead?

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.380
- Now, you are...
- Your elder brother is gentle and kind.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.380
He treats people well,

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.740
brings me food,

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.500
and cares about me.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.860
Most importantly,
he truly respects my decisions.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.580
What?

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:25.220
You ingrate!

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.820
I've treated you so well,
and you remember none of it.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.500
I… I even saved your life, didn't I?

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.700
And as for Jinglan…

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.220
I understand now.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.540
You want me to marry you instead.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.540
I...

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.380
Well...

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.020
Anyway, you can't marry Jinglan.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.660
What?

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.580
Is this really the place
to be talking about this?

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.020
Slow down.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.020
- Hear me out.
- What?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.020
What exactly do you mean?

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.900
- Go away.
- Explain yourself clearly.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.220
Will you stop already?

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.860
Song Zhiyao
has already agreed to marry me.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.460
This is the only thing
I've ever fought for for myself.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.940
Pei Jingheng,

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.100
why are you trying
to snatch my bride from me?

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.700
He won't let me marry Pei Jinglan,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.820
and he won't marry me either.
What does that even mean?

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.780
With all that noise,

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.260
it's obvious she hasn't slept.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.620
Is this her way
of trying to get my attention?

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.260
How could he possibly be able to sleep?

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.260
He hasn't slept?
He was staring at me earlier,

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.580
and now he's looking away.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.420
Does he hate me that much?

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.020
You couldn't be any dumber.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.020
Have you run out of words
to insult people?

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.940
You are treating marriage like a game.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.180
Song Zhiyao, my calling you dumb
is already flattering you.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.980
I can't bear to stay here any longer.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.220
I'll move out tomorrow.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.820
Go ahead and try.
