(Chengguang Hall)

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:14.756
Your Ladyship,
His Highness is out of danger.

00:01:14.757 --> 00:01:16.686
With quiet rest for one month,
he will recover fully.

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:19.000
He must not be subjected
to further stimulation.

00:01:19.436 --> 00:01:20.637
Thank you.

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:35.316
Ru.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.437
Ru.

00:01:39.012 --> 00:01:39.893
Do not go.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:44.437
Do not leave.

00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:47.437
Do not go.

00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:24.482
Every time you see me,

00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.196
is taking my life
all you ever think about?

00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:29.320
I want far more than your life.

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:31.155
I wish I could tear you to pieces

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:32.520
and have you torn apart alive.

00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:35.882
Today, you will repay blood with blood.

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:39.080
Since you want my life,

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:41.756
I will give it to you.

00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.045
You once said,

00:02:45.337 --> 00:02:47.016
my life was yours to begin with.

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:56.167
Your wounds have not healed yet.

00:02:58.036 --> 00:02:59.761
Thank you for saving my life.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.061
I saved your life.

00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:02.724
From now on, that life belongs to me.

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:05.804
From this day forward,
your life and death are mine to decide.

00:03:18.237 --> 00:03:19.797
You still cannot strike.

00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:22.493
After all these years,

00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:24.677
there is still a place for me
in your heart.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.480
Do not flatter yourself.

00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:29.745
I merely missed my aim.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:37.916
If you truly wanted me dead,

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:40.360
you should have stabbed me
through the heart just now.

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:42.799
Let go of me, you shameless scoundrel.

General, you arrived just in time.

00:04:24.587 --> 00:04:26.882
His Highness has urgent matters
to discuss with you.

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:28.036
Very well.

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:56.020
Your Highness,
as you are not yet fully recovered,

00:04:56.077 --> 00:04:58.782
may I ask when you will be able
to return to the army?

00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:00.382
What is this?

00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:02.682
General Su, are you

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.760
that eager for me
to hand over military command?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.031
I would never dare.

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:10.840
The front lines are in crisis, and demands
for battle come day and night.

00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:12.820
I truly have no other choice.

00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:14.395
I beg Your Highness to forgive me.

00:05:15.276 --> 00:05:17.020
When General Su says this,

00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:19.920
do you think I am here enjoying leisure,

00:05:20.437 --> 00:05:21.572
or do you think

00:05:22.236 --> 00:05:23.907
I am deliberately avoiding battle?

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:25.116
Your Highness misunderstands.

00:05:25.317 --> 00:05:27.232
I was never born with grand ambitions.

00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:29.845
Being able to stay in the capital
and protect the one I love

00:05:29.957 --> 00:05:31.332
is already enough for me.

00:05:31.557 --> 00:05:34.495
As for leading troops into battle,
with Your Highness at the front,

00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:36.045
my heart is at ease.

00:06:14.997 --> 00:06:15.717
Ru.

00:06:16.437 --> 00:06:17.332
Stay.

00:06:17.796 --> 00:06:19.570
I can give up everything for you.

00:06:21.557 --> 00:06:23.356
I do not want the realm
or power anymore.

00:06:24.437 --> 00:06:26.036
Your Highness jokes too easily.

00:06:27.197 --> 00:06:28.676
What you have done,

00:06:28.997 --> 00:06:30.596
do you truly not know in your heart?

00:06:30.975 --> 00:06:33.670
And now you speak
such lofty, righteous words.

00:06:33.796 --> 00:06:35.397
Do you not find them laughable?

00:06:36.637 --> 00:06:37.482
Qingru.

00:06:38.437 --> 00:06:39.870
Give me one more chance.

00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:41.795
Let us begin again.

00:06:41.997 --> 00:06:44.120
Begin again?

00:06:45.796 --> 00:06:46.796
Yuwen Que,

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:50.116
do you know how I survived
these past three years?

00:06:50.997 --> 00:06:52.195
Every single day,

00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:54.476
I cursed you to die a miserable death.

00:06:55.557 --> 00:06:58.170
And now you come speaking
such hypocritical words of love.

00:06:59.197 --> 00:07:02.007
Do you truly think I am still
the Shen Qingru I once was?

00:07:06.156 --> 00:07:07.036
Qingru.

00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:09.675
What must I do

00:07:09.676 --> 00:07:11.277
for you to return to my side?

00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:18.545
Heng Dao.

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:21.170
Your Highness.

00:07:21.356 --> 00:07:23.032
Go back and tell His Majesty for me,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.262
that I am gravely wounded, and must remain
in the capital to recuperate.

00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:29.245
Have Su Changji
take command in my stead.

00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:30.657
Yes.

00:07:35.197 --> 00:07:36.355
Has Su Changji not always

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:37.877
wanted my position?

00:07:39.757 --> 00:07:41.436
Today is the Gods' Bathing Festival.

00:07:41.437 --> 00:07:43.286
(Gods' Bathing Festival)
By imperial decree of the Emperor,

00:07:43.287 --> 00:07:44.475
the people are permitted

00:07:44.476 --> 00:07:46.355
to celebrate together
while wearing masks.

00:07:46.356 --> 00:07:48.196
When the drums sound three times,

00:07:48.197 --> 00:07:49.957
fated bonds
shall be sealed for this life.

00:07:49.997 --> 00:07:51.756
May all under heaven

00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:54.045
be blessed with good destiny.

00:08:12.837 --> 00:08:13.996
How lively it is.

00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:27.957
Ru.

00:08:49.756 --> 00:08:51.082
(I have inquired for so long,)

00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:53.920
(I finally know His Highness is wearing
the Azure Dragon mask today.)

00:08:54.037 --> 00:08:55.595
(This Gods' Bathing Festival destiny,)

00:08:55.596 --> 00:08:57.157
(I have waited three whole years.)

00:08:57.716 --> 00:08:58.556
(Today,)

00:08:58.716 --> 00:09:00.570
(I must seize His Highness' hand,)

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:02.165
(and tell him how I truly feel.)

00:09:02.797 --> 00:09:03.757
Sister.

00:09:04.037 --> 00:09:05.515
I just saw that gentleman

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:07.316
wearing the Azure Dragon mask.

00:09:07.917 --> 00:09:10.397
He was standing beneath
that osmanthus tree.

00:09:26.437 --> 00:09:27.457
Careful.

00:09:51.197 --> 00:09:55.755
Joy belongs to this night,
gentle affection meets its finest hour.

00:09:55.756 --> 00:09:57.956
Remove the mask.

00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:06.436
No wonder you looked
so familiar at the time.

00:10:09.077 --> 00:10:09.956
Your Ladyship?

00:10:10.516 --> 00:10:12.076
General Su?

00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:19.277
Trying to leave?

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:24.036
This must be fate.

00:10:24.037 --> 00:10:25.707
Everything was part of your design.

00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:34.716
Careful.

00:10:35.717 --> 00:10:38.517
The way you treated me back then,
did you ever show a shred of sincerity?

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:39.597
Sincerity?

00:10:39.716 --> 00:10:41.316
You dare speak of sincerity?

00:10:42.037 --> 00:10:43.237
Let me ask you again.

00:10:45.677 --> 00:10:46.796
Kill me or flay me,

00:10:47.236 --> 00:10:48.517
I submit to whatever you choose.

00:10:49.236 --> 00:10:50.916
The one thing I regret most in this life

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.556
is ever believing you.

00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:46.316
Is it really so easy

00:11:46.317 --> 00:11:48.115
to enter someone's heart
and then walk away?

00:11:48.116 --> 00:11:49.820
You slaughtered my entire family.

00:11:50.636 --> 00:11:52.956
What right do you have
to speak to me of sincerity?

00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:55.796
Ru.

00:11:56.236 --> 00:11:58.107
I will uncover the truth.

00:11:58.476 --> 00:12:00.020
I will personally kill your enemy.

00:12:00.876 --> 00:12:01.820
Kill!
