[Silent Tides]

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030
[Episode 18]

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.630
Tell the General

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.300
I want an apple pie.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.460
A large one.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.180
Apple pie?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.789
Go get him

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.380
an apple pie.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.180
Yes, sir.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.110
You've loved apple pie
since you were little.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.370
So whenever we were eating out,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.980
I always made sure

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.750
to get a large one.

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:21.510
You said

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.090
that having a good appetite is a blessing.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.690
I even told my friends

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.910
that when you were this tall,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.990
you could already

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.350
finish a huge apple pie in one go.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.880
They didn't believe me.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.130
How old

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.350
were you then?

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.230
I was seven.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.410
Seven years old.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.320
Right.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.500
It was when you were seven.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.470
That Christmas Eve,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.670
many people came to our house.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.600
Dad was entertaining guests,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.630
and Mom was busy cooking.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.780
So it was just the two of us,
playing hide-and-seek.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.320
You always lost to me at hide-and-seek.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.100
So that day, you said

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.829
you had to beat me once.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.470
When I was seven,

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.230
my brother and I

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.920
were taken in
by the Benevolence Orphanage.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.730
My parents passed away

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.930
before I could even remember anything.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.230
Yes.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.130
I said I wanted to beat you once.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
Later, we really couldn't find you.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.310
The whole family panicked

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.040
and looked for you everywhere.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.980
Mom was so worried she cried.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.040
Dad almost called the police.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.850
I was young then

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.180
and didn't know better.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.160
But I really didn't mean to
scare everyone.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.710
It wasn't until midnight,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.769
when I heard you singing
"Bright Moonlight,"

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.130
that I finally found you
in the backyard storage room.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.720
Well, that was such a dark place.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.010
How did you find the courage

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.220
to hide there?

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.840
Do you remember?

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.550
I remember.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.760
General.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.240
We didn't agree to the meeting

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.340
just to let them waste time reminiscing.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.260
We can't just let them

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.790
ramble on like this, can we?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.010
No rush. Let's keep listening.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.810
It's been so long since I've seen you,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.010
and the first thing I do is bring up

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.430
all those old memories.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.240
Are you annoyed?

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.750
Not at all.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.340
Renyu.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.190
I remember everything

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.220
you said.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.690
I won't be by your side anymore.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.280
Take good care of yourself.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.260
Okay?

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.810
Don't worry.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.550
I'll be fine.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.690
That's true.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.310
You've always had

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.340
a mind of your own,
ever since you were little.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.480
You'll definitely be fine.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.100
Actually, it's me who should be worried.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.580
I'm always hesitant in everything I do,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.810
overthinking,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.930
and not brave enough.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.140
That's not true.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.080
Let me finish.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.380
Yinwan.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.760
Mm.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.940
Everything you did

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.630
was right,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.080
all of it.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.700
Your sense of responsibility,
your bravery—

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:32.560
I'm proud of you.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.520
Of course, in my heart,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.310
I also have a wish.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.760
I hope

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.630
that I can be like you,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.010
brave

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.070
and responsible.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.750
So that you can be proud of me too.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.960
Renyu.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.150
Eat.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.080
I want to see General Yazaki.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.860
Let my sister go,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.380
and I'll tell you

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.440
where the batch of banknote paper is.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.830
She's my only sister.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.820
For her, I can give up everything.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.380
Mr. Qiao, you're indeed a smart man.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.130
Deal.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.880
Renyu.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.480
Are you full, Yinwan?

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:00.880
Hmm.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.960
I'm full.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.560
Then I won't keep you any longer.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.130
Go back now.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.380
Be good.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.700
Don't delay what needs to be done.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.179
Renyu...

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.740
Mr. Qiao,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.820
we've fulfilled your request

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.200
and let your sister leave.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.150
Now,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.550
it's your turn to tell us
where the batch of banknote paper is.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.120
Qiao Renyu,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.050
you should know this very well.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.430
If you don't tell the truth,

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.390
your sister

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.610
will never be able to leave Hong Kong.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.620
Xian.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.860
Yinwan!

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.030
Be proud of me!

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.160
Brother!

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.040
Brother!

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.080
I'm proud of you.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.370
All units, attention.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.010
The target is moving.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.290
Thank you.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.220
Miss, feel free to look around.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.260
Hmm.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.220
She just bought a violin?

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.450
Yes. She said she's going to use it
to commemorate a relative.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.290
She said nothing else besides that.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.750
We've already taken
the violin shop owner in for questioning.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.270
Keep watching her.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.720
This is the information

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.920
we've found so far on the Qiao siblings.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.710
We're still gathering the rest.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.550
Leave nothing out.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.290
Investigate everyone who's had dealings
with them in the past.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:23.820
Yes, sir.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.190
Play it again.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:27.940
Yes, sir.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.530
Brother!

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.270
Yinwan, don't be afraid. I'm here.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:33.670
This woman has been

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.670
running all over the Island all day.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.390
She leaves a white flower

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.000
and plays a violin piece at each stop.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.120
We've quickly verified

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.500
that the places she's been to

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.840
are either where the siblings used to live

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.120
or where Qiao Renyu studied or worked.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.430
This woman barely interacts with anyone.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.500
Everyone who has spoken to her—

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.960
and even those who merely stopped
to listen to her play—have been

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.290
taken back to the Military Police Station
for questioning.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.280
But no suspicious targets
have been found so far.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.070
Continue monitoring her.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.290
Do not miss a single clue.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:11.990
Yes, sir.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.140
Miss, what would you like to drink?

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.580
I'll have a macchiato.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.580
Certainly. Please wait a moment.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.290
Don't get close.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.390
Yinwan is surrounded by secret agents.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.500
But what if we miss

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.840
her playing?

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.200
We won't.
She knows the distance between us.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.670
She'll make sure we hear her playing.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.880
She's about to start playing.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.890
The sound of a violin can travel far.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:14.130
[One day ago]

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.430
But if you suddenly play
at a random location,

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.089
won't that be too conspicuous

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.099
and draw the enemy's attention?

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.910
Then I'll play more pieces

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.330
and visit more places

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.900
to confuse them.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.350
Hong Kong is where my brother and I

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.500
used to live.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.080
Now, everything has changed.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.720
After seeing my brother,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.450
I'll be filled with nostalgia.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.540
It's natural that I want to visit places
where we once lived,

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.460
walk around,

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.700
and play music to express my longing.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.700
That makes sense, doesn't it?

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.430
This plan is good.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:54.720
We just need to agree beforehand

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.170
on a specific piece

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.430
to serve as the signal.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.810

Here.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.500
Why is all of this
about Qiao Renyu's work again?

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.170
The siblings talked mostly about
their childhood.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.170
Their childhood!

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.200
Go find information about their childhood!

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.780
Yes, sir.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.240
Chief.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.690
Due to the recent war in Hong Kong,

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.800
archives and records everywhere

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.740
have been severely damaged or lost.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.950
Records of children from 20 years ago

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.890
really aren't easy to find.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.390
Then, in the General's name,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.690

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.150
to halt all other work.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.190
every page of records left by the British,

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.040

Yes, sir.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.530
You might not even see us

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.670
from beginning to end.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.390
Throughout the entire process,

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.190
you'll have to rely on yourself.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.960
It's alright.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.270
Although I can't see you,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.250
I know in my heart

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.660
that you will always be behind me.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.620
Promise me you'll be careful.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.190
Do you remember the song we agreed on?

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:00.690
I'll go get my violin and play it for you.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:01.610
No need.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.780
When I went to Zhongshan to buy grain

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:05.990
and you came to see me off,

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.720
the song you played was that one.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.850
I still remember it.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.980
"Auld Lang Syne." This is the one.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.240
Once I play the agreed-upon piece,

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.700
the actual location
my brother told me about

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.740
is 50 meters from my last stop,

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.390
on the opposite side.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.470
Miss Qiao's previous stop

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.240
was the café on Garden Road.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.240
According to the agreement,

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.180
from the café, then across the street.

[Naval Club]

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:58.850
That should be...

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.900
The Japanese Naval Club.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.760
We've already checked.

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.740
That place used to be an orphanage.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.740
After Hong Kong fell,
it was occupied by the Japanese.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.340
Now it's been converted into
their Naval Club.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.800
Which orphanage?

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.930
The one affiliated with St. John's Church,

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.330
Benevolence Orphanage.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.560
I remember that day was Christmas.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.260
It was my first time
seeing the priest and the nuns.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.390
I was terrified,

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.740
so I hid inside a concealed wall.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.630
It was built behind a statue
of the Virgin Mary,

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.870
and the switch was actually
one of her shoes.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.200
I stumbled into it completely
by accident—

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.020
somehow, I just crawled in.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.190
A concealed wall?

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.990
That's right.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.370
This kind of concealed wall, meant to
prevent theft, is extremely well hidden.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.260
Ordinary people would never find it.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.780
That's why Mr. Qiao Renyu

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.190
hid the batch of banknote paper there.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.110
Oh dear.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.570
We've found the location,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:55.460
but it's now become

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.860
the Japanese Naval Club.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.190
Two truckloads of stuff—

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.830
how are we supposed to get it out?

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.950
When Mr. Qiao hid them,

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.830
he never imagined
the Japanese would be so shameless

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.690
as to take over even an orphanage.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.310

What Qiao Renyu hinted at

must be some hidden location
in the orphanage.

has no mechanism.

Even if we can't catch up,

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.340
Mr. Huang,

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.830
it's pitch black out there,

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:40.930
and the Lingding Channel is so vast.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:42.930
Where are we supposed to block them?

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.620
Japanese warships are chasing them.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.980
They're sure to take the quickest route.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.060
They don't dare risk wasting time
by taking detours.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.520
We'll block them right at
this Hong Kong-Macau shipping lane.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:55.810
It's definitely the right move.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:56.540
Understood.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.390
Wait.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.420
Tonight the wind is from the east.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.910
The sound of engines

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.650
will carry toward us.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.630
At night,

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.460
your ears are more useful than your eyes.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.520
Tell everyone to prick up their ears!

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.160
As soon as you spot the target,

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.500
fire a signal flare.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.180
Yes.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.140
That woman, Qiao Yinwan,

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:26.210
is no longer worth... keeping alive.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.060
Arrest her.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.140
Immediately!

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:34.660
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.940
[Brother Qiao Renyu's Tomb]

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:03.300
Look, up ahead are the waters of Macau.
