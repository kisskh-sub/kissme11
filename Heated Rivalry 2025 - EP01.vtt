00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.152
OK?
- OK.

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:21.323
- OK. One more time, guys.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.160
The more serious we can do,
the quicker we go home. Go.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:25.661
(Both laughing)

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:26.829

00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:27.830
- OK.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:28.956
(Both laughing)

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.833
- Oh, I can do it. I promise.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.835
- And three, two, one, go ahead.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.296
(Both laughing)

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:36.505
OK.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:39.175
OK, I think we have what
we are gonna get here.

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.509
Thanks, guys!

00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:42.970
- When they tell you
you do commercial with me

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.221
and not just alone?

00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:47.016
- I don't know,
like, two days ago?

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:51.228
Why? When did they tell you?

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:53.522
- No, they told me nothing.
It was my idea.

00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:58.152
- (Man): Shane!

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:01.489
- Shane, are you
listening to me?

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:02.865
- What? Yeah.

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.575
- OK, so what did I just say?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.035
- Sneakers, I heard.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.495
- OK, you have to be seen
in your Reeboks.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.871
- I know, Mom.

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.372
- Because you cannot
be in anything else.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:11.874
- Mom, I'm always
wearing skates.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.542
- But in case you're not.

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:15.044
This is a lot of money, Shane.

00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.712
You're the youngest
hockey player

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:18.214
they've ever signed to a deal.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:20.883
And remember
what else this means.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.551
- I remember.

00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:24.929
- A whole lot of kids are
gonna be looking up to you,

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.306
kids that don't
see themselves here a lot.

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:28.849
- I get it, Mom.

00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:21.527
Fuck off.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.477
Not here.

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:08.157
So, uh, look, we can forget
that happened in there, OK?

00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:12.328
- Is what you want?

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:14.663
- Yeah, for sure.

You are a really bad liar.

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.474
What is your room number?

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:39.688
- 1410.

00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:46.278
- Well, if I come
to 1410 tonight at 9:00...

00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.448
- I might open.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.201
- I might knock.

lie on the bed
and let you do it some more?

- I know you're an asshole.

00:23:22.692 --> 00:23:25.237

leave you like that.

00:26:58.033 --> 00:27:00.160
It's a lie. Liar told you that.

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.828
I said 50.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.622
(Reporters laughing)

00:27:03.747 --> 00:27:05.332
- What a fucking asshole.

00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:08.710
♪ ♪ ♪

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:24.768
- Ah!

00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:26.227
- Sorry I'm late.

00:27:26.394 --> 00:27:28.313
- It's 15 minutes.
Don't even worry about it.

00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:30.940
- We don't care. It's just that
you're usually on time.

00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:32.692
- My workout went
longer than expected,

00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.402
and I got lost
in a YouTube rabbit hole.

00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:36.780
- It's fine. I ordered for you.
Salmon, brown rice.

00:27:36.905 --> 00:27:37.906
- Thanks.
- OK.

00:27:38.031 --> 00:27:40.200
So, I have very exciting news.

00:27:40.325 --> 00:27:41.493
- What's YouTube?

00:27:41.618 --> 00:27:43.703
- Rolex is in.

00:27:43.828 --> 00:27:44.996
- Wow!

00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:46.581
- Let me pull up the email.

00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:47.874
(Clears throat)

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.584
And I quote...

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.713
"Shane is exactly the kind
of young athlete and young man

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.924
"that Rolex wants to
be associated with.

00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:58.802
He's smart, he's serious,
he's handsome."

00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:01.388
That's an understatement.
- God, Mom.

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:03.223
- "And we believe he will be

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:07.519
hockey's most significant
ambassador in a generation."

00:28:07.644 --> 00:28:09.187
- Is Rolex on YouTube?

00:28:09.312 --> 00:28:10.355
(Sighing)

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.232
- YouTube is like
a video portal site.

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:15.068
- I'm not convinced I know
what any of those words mean.

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:17.112
- So, a rabbit hole
is where you watch a video,

00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:18.446
it recommends other videos,

00:28:18.613 --> 00:28:19.572
and you keep clicking them.

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:20.532
- Sounds dangerous.

00:28:20.657 --> 00:28:21.950
- Oh, yeah.

00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:23.702
I go down those rabbit
holes all the time.

00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.036
- Of course you do, Mom.

00:28:25.161 --> 00:28:26.663
- What was yours about?
- Fancy watches?

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:28.748
- David!
- What? I'm just keeping up.

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.417
- Unlikely animals
becoming friends,

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:34.212
like a tiger and a bear,
a cow and a duck.

00:28:34.337 --> 00:28:35.088
- Come on!

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.631
- Yeah, a snake and a baby.

00:28:36.756 --> 00:28:38.800
I'd watch that.

00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:41.344
- Well, what you
should be watching

00:28:41.469 --> 00:28:42.762
are the ones about hockey.

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.723
- I think keeping up
with that snake and baby

00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:46.141
sounds pretty important.

00:28:46.307 --> 00:28:48.268
Relationship could go sideways
pretty fast.

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:51.479
- Oh, I saw a link today
about Ilya Rozanov.

00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:53.440
So I click on it, and he says...

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:54.941
Well, first of all,

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:56.776
do you remember at
the beginning of the season,

00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.528
he told someone,
I can't remember who...

00:28:58.653 --> 00:29:00.989
Anyway, he told them that
he was gonna score 40 goals.

00:29:01.114 --> 00:29:02.282
Do you remember that?

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:03.658
- I remember you
yelling something

00:29:03.825 --> 00:29:05.160
about Rozanov turning 40

00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:07.328
and me trying to match
your level of outrage.

00:29:07.495 --> 00:29:10.415
- Well, yesterday in Boston,
he said he meant 50.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.375
50 goals!

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:14.961
- Yeah, he's an asshole.

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.838
- Yeah, the nerve. Fuck him!

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:18.548
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

00:29:18.673 --> 00:29:21.551
OK, imagining he's better
than Gretzky? Better than you?

00:29:21.676 --> 00:29:22.635
(Scoffing)

00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:25.138
Fuck him. Right up the butt.

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.014
- Yuna!

00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:27.807
- I'm sorry, but I said it.

00:29:27.932 --> 00:29:29.267
- Honestly!

00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:33.980
- <i>Desjardins talking to
McCann and St. Pierre.</i>

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:35.774
<i>It's probably the last
face-off of the game.</i>

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:37.817
<i>Who are they sending in?</i>

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:40.862
- <i>The crowd seems to have ideas.</i>

00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:42.530
(Crowd cheering)

00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:44.282
- <i>Are they gonna do this?</i>

00:29:44.407 --> 00:29:47.118
<i>Are they gonna give the people
what they want?</i>

00:29:47.243 --> 00:29:48.912
- <i>Desjardins is gonna
give it to them.</i>

00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:50.872
- <i>Is Reilly gonna do this too?</i>

00:29:50.997 --> 00:29:52.874
<i>Are we gonna see...</i>

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:54.918
- <i>Listen to that crowd.</i>

00:29:55.043 --> 00:29:56.628
<i>And there you have it!</i>

00:29:56.753 --> 00:29:59.547
<i>It's Ilya Rozanov versus...</i>

00:29:59.714 --> 00:30:01.299
- Shane Hollander.

00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:03.718
Will you disappoint them?

00:30:03.843 --> 00:30:06.221
- No.

00:30:06.387 --> 00:30:08.389
<i>- But a goal off the face-off?
Your first against Rozanov?</i>

00:30:08.556 --> 00:30:10.225
<i>That had to have
felt pretty good?</i>

00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.727
<i>- I'm happy with
any goal I can get.</i>

00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:14.354
<i>- But one off of Rozanov?</i>

00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:17.065
<i>- Again, I'm happy
with any goal.</i>

00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:18.608
<i>- And the face-offs?</i>

00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:22.070
<i>- I'm here for the team.
I'm here to win.</i>

00:30:22.237 --> 00:30:23.738
<i>I don't care about the details.</i>

00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:25.406
<i>- And what do you think
about being compared</i>

00:30:25.532 --> 00:30:27.367
<i>to Tiger Woods
and Serena Williams?</i>

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:30.245
<i>Do you think you share
any of the same challenges?</i>

00:30:31.412 --> 00:30:33.414
<i>- I don't really think
about stuff like that.</i>

00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.042
<i>I'm just super happy
to play for the Metros.</i>

00:30:36.167 --> 00:30:37.836
- Mr. Hollander...

00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:41.381
How does it feel to be perfect?

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:42.423
Fucking perfect.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.384
Thanks for asking.

00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:48.054
In fucking French.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.598
Twenty thousand dollars?

00:30:50.723 --> 00:30:52.183
<i>- Yes, twenty thousand dollars.</i>

00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:55.937
I'm glad your hearing is OK.

00:30:56.062 --> 00:30:57.021
- For what this time?

00:30:57.146 --> 00:30:58.982
- For fuck you.

00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:02.277
- This is the last fucking time.

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:03.778
- Yeah, fine.

00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:05.238
- And I'm not
sending it tonight!

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:06.489
<i>- Why the fuck not?</i>

00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:08.616
- It's. It's midnight here,
Alexei.

00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:11.494
- You always have
some bullshit excuse, Ilya.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.789
- How's Dad?

00:31:14.914 --> 00:31:17.250
<i>- What the fuck is up
with you and Dad?</i>

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:18.835
Jesus fucking Christ!
He is fine!

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.712
We can all live without you.

00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:22.255
Go fuck yourself, Ilya.

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:26.217
- On the phone yesterday,

00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:29.095
he asked me
to bring home some bread.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.306
(Baby crying)

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.641
- Well, he is stupid!

00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:39.814
- Good night, Alexei.

00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:42.442
- First thing
in the morning, Ilya.

00:31:49.115 --> 00:31:51.993
- (Announcer): <i>Here we are
at the MLH All-Star Game,</i>

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.494
<i>and the theme this year</i>

00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:55.163
<i>is Team Hollander
versus Team Rozanov.</i>

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.498
<i>Oh, I'm sorry,
I read that wrong.</i>

00:31:57.624 --> 00:31:59.792
<i>It's Team North America
versus Team Europe.</i>

00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:01.294
- <i>It's not subtle.</i>

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:02.754
<i>Anytime the league
can figure out a way</i>

00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:04.797
<i>to get these two kids
in each other's faces,</i>

00:32:04.923 --> 00:32:06.341
<i>they're gonna do it.</i>

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:08.509
- Ilya, you're having
a legendary rookie season.

00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:09.677
Both of you are.

00:32:09.802 --> 00:32:11.512
You said you'd hit
50 goals this year.

00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:14.432
You've had 28 so far, and we're
in the middle of February.

00:32:14.557 --> 00:32:16.768
You still thinking
about a 50-goal campaign?

00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:18.353
(Cameras clicking)

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.190
- Yes.

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:24.025
- Shane, kind of
the same to you.

00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:25.777
You scored 31 goals.

00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:27.320
Any chance you want to speculate

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:29.197
as to how this season
will end up for you guys?

00:32:29.322 --> 00:32:30.823
- No chance at all.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:33.368
- Question for Ilya first,
but it'll be the same for Shane.

00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:35.495
Boston is an original six
legendary team

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.497
that's struggled
to get to the playoffs

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.706
for the past 3 seasons.

00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:40.416
How much pressure do you feel
from the fans,

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:42.001
from the hockey world
in general,

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:44.337
to restore Boston
to its former glory?

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:47.131
And how much of that do
you take on personally?

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:48.716
(Cameras clicking)

00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:50.593
- Um...

00:32:50.718 --> 00:32:51.594
- Uh...

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:53.012
- Um...

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:55.682
- Sorry, not to
jump the gun here,

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:58.309
but with Rozanov's permission...

00:33:01.396 --> 00:33:03.022
I know it's only been
two seasons

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:04.857
since Montreal's
made the playoffs,

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.567
but I think I get the idea.

00:33:06.693 --> 00:33:10.697
So, look, my mom is
the world's biggest Metros fan.

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:11.948
She's obsessed.

00:33:12.073 --> 00:33:13.449
And like all Metros fans,

00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:16.077
she wants us to be back
in the playoffs regularly,

00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:17.787
and she wants us
to win some cups.

00:33:17.912 --> 00:33:19.747
And I want the same thing.

00:33:19.914 --> 00:33:23.126
I want to be in the playoffs,
and I want to win some cups.

00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:25.086
I feel pretty aligned
with the fans,

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:26.879
'cause we want the same thing.

00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.757
And at this point, it's my job
to take that personally.

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.301
- Ilya?

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:36.723
- What he said.

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:39.017
(Reporters laughing, chatting)

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.979
- <i>And here's the
shot accuracy competition,</i>

00:33:43.104 --> 00:33:46.190
<i>featuring, gasp, Shane Hollander
and Ilya Rozanov.</i>

00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:48.401

00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:30.151
- With your team.

00:34:30.318 --> 00:34:32.361
Get dinner, get drunk?

00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:35.281

but I didn't get drunk.

- Yeah, it was great.

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:44.248
No boring Canadians,
no stupid Americans.

00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:45.958

of Finnish guys

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:48.377

they're in love with?

00:34:50.838 --> 00:34:52.924

early tonight.

00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:54.383

00:34:56.844 --> 00:34:59.430

00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:04.936

00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.479

00:35:07.814 --> 00:35:10.024
Glad to see Rozanov

00:35:10.191 --> 00:35:11.150
for more than a minute.

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:13.152
What did he want, by the way?

00:35:13.277 --> 00:35:15.446
Oh, nothing,
just shit-talking.

00:35:15.571 --> 00:35:17.073
- He's an asshole, right?

00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:18.825
- I mean, yeah, basically.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.326

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:23.204

00:35:45.017 --> 00:35:47.520
- I'm standing in the hallway
like an idiot.

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.814
Scott Hunter is right next door.

00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:52.400

Fuck, Rozanov.

- Get on your stomach.
On your stomach.

00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:11.479
Have you ever?

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.731
Do you want to?

00:37:17.443 --> 00:37:18.861
You're scared.

00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:20.196
- I'm not scared.

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:21.280
- No, it's OK.

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:22.823
- I'm not scared.

touch yourself here?

00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:33.292
- Jesus Christ.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.796
- What? Does touching your ass
make you gay?

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:38.005
- Rozanov...

00:37:38.172 --> 00:37:39.924
- 'Cause you know what else
makes you gay

00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:40.967
is sucking my dick.

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.551

00:37:42.677 --> 00:37:43.761
Fuck.

00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:47.974
I'm trying to say
I have a thing. OK?

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:49.392
- A thing?

00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:51.936
- A dildo.

00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.025
- What color?

00:37:58.192 --> 00:37:59.318
- Fuck you.

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:00.361

00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:01.362

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:02.530
- No, no, Hollander.

00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:04.532
I want to fuck you.

00:38:12.498 --> 00:38:14.000
- Not here.

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:17.378
Not with fucking
Scott Hunter next door.

00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:19.505
- He is hot.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.341
We should let him listen
like mating call.

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:24.552
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Mm-hmm.

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.554
You probably would too.

00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:32.977
OK. So next time.

00:38:35.354 --> 00:38:36.939
- Next time?

00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:38.816
- Yeah, we're playing
Montreal in two weeks.

00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:43.279
- Yeah. But, um,
where would we...

00:38:43.404 --> 00:38:45.239
- Where would we what?

00:38:45.364 --> 00:38:46.699
- Meet?

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.035
- You are homeless?

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.119
- No.

00:38:50.244 --> 00:38:51.454
- Then we meet at your house.

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:52.997
- It's an apartment.

00:38:54.081 --> 00:38:56.542
- Hollander, you are having
a panic attack.

00:38:59.628 --> 00:39:00.588
(Chuckling)

00:39:00.713 --> 00:39:02.798
It's just a plan to fuck.

- Uh, I know we talked about
Montreal in two weeks, but...

00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:37.958
- Oh my God, Hollander,
you are so boring.

00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:41.462
Give me your phone.

00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:46.050
You have phone.

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.011
Give.

00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:41.522
No one's getting
into Montreal today.

It's not the end of the world.

to come over to my place

00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:15.181
for dinner tonight, do you?

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.223
- What?

00:41:16.348 --> 00:41:17.558
- Since there's no game.

00:41:17.725 --> 00:41:19.226
Come for dinner.
Jacki said it's cool.

00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:22.354
Oh, that's my wife.
She can throw on some steaks.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.064
- I--I'm on a macrobiotic diet.

00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:26.692
- Buddy, I don't even know
what that means.

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:28.152
But Jacki can cook anything.

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:32.156
You OK?
- Yeah, I guess.

00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:35.034
- Hey, if you have other plans,
that's--that's totally cool.

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:38.078
- No, I want to watch you eat
my disgusting food. Let's do it.

00:41:38.245 --> 00:41:40.122
- Fuck yes!
God, Jacki's gonna be so happy.

She's obsessed with being
the first wag to feed you.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.085

What the fuck
are you doing here?

00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:31.465
- Being nice,
but I already regret it.

- Sounds like you.

00:42:33.092 --> 00:42:34.969

- Sorry. I didn't expect you.

00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:42.184

- That your game was cancelled?

00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:44.019
It was announced, asshole.

00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:48.107

00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:25.264
- I'm not.

00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:27.975
- Good for you.

00:45:28.142 --> 00:45:29.977
Big night for you.

00:45:30.102 --> 00:45:33.439
- Yeah, well, it could have
gone to either one of us.

00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:36.483
- It went to you.

00:45:39.486 --> 00:45:41.113
- So what?

00:45:41.238 --> 00:45:43.073
You're just up here sulking
because, what,

00:45:43.198 --> 00:45:45.617
you couldn't take
another victory lap around me?

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.327
All you do is beat me.

00:45:47.453 --> 00:45:50.456
I win one fucking thing, and
you can't even show your face.

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.124
(Murmuring)

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:54.960
What was that?
- Not everything is about you!

00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:57.421
- So what is it then?

00:45:57.546 --> 00:45:59.131
- What the fuck do you want?

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.467
- Nothing. I just wanted to
see the view and get some air.

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.469
- And what? Here is
fucking view, Hollander.

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:06.013
Check it out. Fuck!

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.524
I go home in three days.

00:46:19.234 --> 00:46:20.360
- OK.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:22.988
That must be nice.

00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:28.494
(Sighing)

00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:43.217
And I guess
I thought maybe we...

00:46:50.432 --> 00:46:51.642
Never mind.

00:46:51.767 --> 00:46:54.186
OK, I'm gonna...

00:47:00.108 --> 00:47:04.112
I guess I'll, uh,
see you next season.

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:37.062
What the fuck are you doing?

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.398
We're both in tuxedos
out in public.

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:40.440
- No one is looking.

00:47:40.607 --> 00:47:42.025
- You don't know that.

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:57.499
- See you next season!

00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:00.878
Hollander.

00:48:02.087 --> 00:48:05.966
(Door opening, closing)

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.318
