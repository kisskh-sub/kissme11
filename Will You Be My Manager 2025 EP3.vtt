Look at this! The likes are through the roof!

Thailand, Indonesia, even America!

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.740
Folks from all over the world are liking our videos!

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.550
Great job, Hana-chan.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.810
You and Eun Ho did all the hard work.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.410
Don't say that.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.770
- Did you have breakfast?
- Nope.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.550
Shall we grab something from the store?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.170
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.310
I'm starving!

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.700
Oh? When did you get these?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.380
I've got everything.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.090
Apply it for me! I even lowered myself to your height.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.590
Did you see the posts from Hana's team?

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.600
It's insane, right?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.190
I really thought I was eating pork cutlets with Gu Eun Ho.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.310
It isn't just eating with him!

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.480
His precious hands cut it for me!

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.190
It'll be amazing if it became a series.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.310
Oh, a series is a great idea.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.760
But I guess someone's going to be jealous if they blow up.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.180
Come on.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.950
Let's go, let's go.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.070
A series?

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.130
Ji Ah!

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.250
- Did I scare you?
- Yeah, what else?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.170
<i>Especially after you filmed all that.</i>

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.260
Sorry, I was too excited.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.010
Actually, I hate it when people touch me.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.530
Really? I didn't know, I'm so sorry.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.410
I'll be careful from now on.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.740
Sorry, you had to put up with me for so long.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.800
Ji Ah, do you want something sweet?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.580
A candy or some gummies?

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.570
Are you going to make a series?

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.110
The stuff about male friends.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.760
You saw it?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.260
I was about to go to bed,
but the notifications kept popping up.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.810
At first, I thought I was dreaming.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.170
Even now, it still feels unreal.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.900
So, is it going to be a series?

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.330
Yes.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.420
I owe it all to you.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.370
You said that even a selfie would work.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.170
Instead of selfies, I uploaded memories.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.630
I work my life out trying to complete assignments,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.080
but you sound like you're just making memories with the guys.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.510
Ji Ah, you're capable.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.440
I have nothing.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.460
Eun Ho and Si Woo are doing all the hard work.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.430
I guess that's right.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.820
Group distribution is all about luck.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.510
I'm going to throw up my lunch.

Hey, get up. We have to practice.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.480
We can't get up, or it'll be disastrous.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.770
Just curious, but do you have insurance?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.830
No clue...

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.100
Should I call my mom?

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.200
What? Go on sleeping.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.880
- Should I turn off the lights?
- Ji Ah.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.960
Give us a break. Ba Reun, tell her.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.260
Let her know how hard we were practicing!

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.180

Why can we only like a post once?

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.130
Why? Why's that?

You know that my dream is to be Eun Ho's girlfriend, right?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.230
But...

Your group's reels are a real feast!

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.980
It's freaking crazy, like I'm on a date with Eun Ho.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.940
Is that a compliment?

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.390
Hell yes!

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.320

- That's a great idea.

I thought the assignment was too hard
since you hadn't posted anything even until yesterday.

- Dang!

This is the first time you've come in second, right?

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.810
Shouldn't this call for a commemorative photo?

Ji Ah.

Huh? She told me to get lost, but she left.

But she lets you get close because you're Ba Reun's cousin.

They're really interesting.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.820
Hana-chan did nothing except film them!

But I'm the only one serious about this!

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.380
You should just film us casually, too. Don't be too serious.

Don't say that.

Okay.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.690
She's very sensitive and concerned about her grades.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.150
During the workshop, keeping your distance
as competitors is better.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.000
Is Ji Ah...

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.590
being nice to me just because I'm your cousin?

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.390
Be honest.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:48.110
That was how it started,
but she seemed to gradually treat you as her friend.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:53.750
Right now, I think she's riled up
because grades matter to her.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:01.340
Tell her...

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.450
I've always seen her as a friend.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.200
Damn, is Gu Eun Ho insane? My dear kitty...

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.930
Yikes.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.050
Long time no see, "Ugh" Ji Ah. You make my eyes hurt.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.950
Hang on.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.200
What?

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.950
I guess you aren't keeping up with old habits.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.340
Of course not, the manager's doing everything for me.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.870
So dumb.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:44.060
It isn't for you, they're enjoying their time.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.060
Who are you talking about?

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.410
Gu Eun Ho and his manager.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.230
They're recording their memories.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.470
Social media has always been an exhibit of happiness.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.990
I've heard that she visits his house often.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.630
Is that why he came to me?

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.880
Is that why he calls her that?

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.290
Damn it.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.400
<i>If you don't show any respect,</i>

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.670
<i>I'll do the same.</i>

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.510
Eun Ho?

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.870
This looks like someone...

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.280
Did you fall out with Shin Ji Ah?

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.890
No.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.010
It isn't a fight, we're just giving each other space.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.750
What? Are you two a couple?

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:27.770
What's the most important thing to you?

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.800
What about you?

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.110
Friends.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.960
Try guessing where it is.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.360
If you get it right, you'll make up with Ji Ah.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.740
I told you, we didn't fight.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.740
The right hand.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.540
You're right.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.820
Take it.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.510
Isn't this...

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.970
I have more at home.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.820
Thank you.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.780
I'll keep it with me like a lucky charm.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.370
A lucky charm that gives me courage.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.610
Do whatever you want.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.380
I'm off.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.950
What is it this time?

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.350
Now that I think about it,

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.750
your face doesn't appear in the reels.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.760
I guess I can film Eun Ho, too.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.900
You can't do that. It's our course's assignment.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.540
I'm also great at video editing.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.940
Let's crush Shin Ji Ah for good this time.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.630
Don't wanna do it?

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.650
You're using your assignment as an excuse
to make happy memories with our Eun Ho.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.530
What have you been doing in the club room?

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.680
Did you come here to seduce Eun Ho?

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.360
If you become a manager, your artistes' lives will be ruined.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.370
A manager who's so satisfied with her job
and brimming with ulterior motives.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.270
A scheming and utterly disgusting manager.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.380
Go bother Cheon Si Woo.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.600
Why are you clinging to Eun Ho...

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.410
Stop messing with me!

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.720
It's your turn next.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:46.230
You trampled over what I treasure the most.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.760
What? The keychain?

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.800
What's the big deal with that?

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.680
This isn't the first time you're doing this.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.640
At first, you wanted to send Ji Ah to hell.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.940
Have you been to hell yourself?

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.970
I have.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.830
Secondly, Si Woo.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.380
Are you even worthy of saying his name?

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.460
Thirdly, Eun Ho.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:24.310
Dream about becoming a human
before thinking about being his girlfriend.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.830
Lastly, Suzu and me.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.900
I'll count to five.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.980
Get out of my sight.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:43.490
One, two, three...

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.190
What happened?

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.950
She's definitely a gangster's daughter.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.600
What?

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.250
There's something really off about her.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.090
Interesting.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.530
I can't sit with her.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.030
I'm also really scared of her now.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.120
She's like a different person.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.640
But at least she didn't use her fists.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.340
So handsome!

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.810
So freaking good-looking!

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.370
And he's so tall! I bet he's a model!

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.490
Take a photo! Quick!

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.720
But can we just take photos?

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.320
Here, wear this.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.320
I think people recognize you.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.860
Let's go. Si Woo says he'll be late.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.750
But people are staring.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.600
Fine, give it to me.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:53.960
The weather's great today. What should we do?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.710
Let's start with eating instant noodles,
and then riding the duck boats.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.240
Do you get motion sickness?

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.640
Let's have a picnic or something.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.150
A picnic?

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.040
You should've said so earlier.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.040
I would've prepared for it.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.880
There's nothing much to prepare.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.790
What are you doing?

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.230
- Follow me.
- Hey!

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.780
What is all this?

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.340
What do you think? I tried to fit our group's concept.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.790
We had a concept?

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.760
You came up with it, eating and having fun without worries.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.790
Come on, sit down.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.690
I bet you're hungry.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.740
Hana-chan, let's watch a movie.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.430
I picked these movies.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.090
Want to watch them?

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.320
I like this one.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.900
How about watching this?

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.160
Or this one?

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.750
<i>A kind male friend who prepared a surprise picnic.</i>

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.530
Skip the movie. Let's play games.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.350
The loser gets flicked on the forehead.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.540
Aren't you going to take a block?

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.750
Are you just going to film?

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.340
Hey.

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.400
Hana-chan, it's your turn.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:21.240
<i>An aloof male friend who flicked my forehead gently.</i>

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.040
Hang on!

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:06.300
<i>And me, smiling brightly without any worries.</i>

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.950
Make way. I'll do it.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.030
It's almost done anyway.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.160
I guess you're having fun.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.680
Yeah!

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.340
But...

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.090
you're a manager, so why are you acting?

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.050
[Epilogue]

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:17.750
Sorry.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.150
Sorry.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.630
Sorry, Suzu.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.640
Sorry.
