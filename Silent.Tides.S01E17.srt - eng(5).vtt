You really have 10,000 Pounds in HSBC?

It was handled by Qiao Renyu.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.840
But I lost my deposit certificates.
Now, to withdraw the money,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.580
I have to ask him. Understand?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.990
But...

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.020
He's a death row prisoner
of the Gendarmerie Army.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.970
Heavily guarded.
No one is allowed to contact him.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.079
Do you understand?

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.650
Mr. Fujii, please, please. Just... Just...

Don't touch me!

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.210
It's gonna take one minute. One minute!

How does it sound?

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.740
In the past week,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.750
Macau's businesses have nearly collapsed.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.079
Citizens can't even secure
rice or vegetables.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.930
The Portuguese Macau government

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.890
probably won't last more than a month.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.329
The Empire's military currency
will inevitably be adopted.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.240
Well done.

there are no urgent matters in Macau now.

If you have no other instructions,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.020
I'd like to go to Stanley Prison

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.210
to interrogate Qiao Renyu once more.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.870
Sawa, the HKD has been abolished.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.560
Why waste your time?

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.579
General,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.180
I don't care about
the leaked serial numbers.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.860
I want to find Qiao Renyu's collaborators

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.370
and uncover
the anti-Japanese organizations in Macau.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.960
I see.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.090
Since you insist,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.300
very well.
I'll authorize the interrogation.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.340
Thank you.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.820
Qiao Renyu is locked in the innermost cell
of the death row section.

Don't you know the prisoners inside

you...

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.010
made a great contribution to the Empire.

This is truly a great contribution!

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.370
Unfortunately, this William...

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.850
doesn't know
where the printing plates are.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.830
Are you sure he was telling the truth?

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.830
This Englishman is a coward.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.120
Before we even tortured him,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.370
he betrayed even his own wife.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.090
I don't think he was lying.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.690
In that case,

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.050
the only one
who knows where the printing plates are

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.570
is Qiao Renyu.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.680
After learning this,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.930
I interrogated the HSBC staff.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.830
According to them,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.930
after Qiao Renyu returned
to the bank that day

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.420
and completed the task
of transferring the printing plates,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.120
he met with Mr. Grayburn of HSBC

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.920
and had a conversation with him.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480
That means

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.060
Mr. Grayburn might also know about it.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.100
Judging from this operation
to rescue Qiao Renyu,

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.860
the Allied Forces not only have

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.010
a dedicated intelligence station in Macau,

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.160
allowing them to learn about
the printing plates earlier than we did,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.090
but have also

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.890
formed close cooperation

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.860
with the underground
anti-Japanese organizations.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.640
Looks like their strength
cannot be underestimated.

that has been detained
at Tsim Sha Tsui Pier

Well...

the Japanese Hong Kong Command.

To be honest,

before you called me for this meeting,

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.250
I had already planned
to resign from Lyun Coeng.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.660

would only put you at risk.

don't you?

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.700

But you're the one holding us together.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:48.270
You have to pull yourself together

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:49.130
and think about

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:51.550
how to remedy the situation.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.350
I know.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.070
In my office drawer,

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.350
there's a list of all HSBC employees

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.660
and their families.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.180
Go now.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.080
Arrest 100 people first—

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.940
only the elderly,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.010
women, and children.

Bring them here,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.530
and right

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.350
in front of him,

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.500
put them through every form of torture

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.940
that he and Mr. Grayburn endured.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.280
If once isn't enough,

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.900
do it twice.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.130
bring in the next.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.360
When those 100 people are dead,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.720

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.510

Of course I'm here to see Miss Qiao.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.310
Miss Qiao Yinwan,

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.850
General Yazaki
personally wrote this invitation.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.830
Colonel Sawa specifically asked me
to deliver it to you.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.680
Yazaki?

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.070
To show their sincerity, the Imperial Army

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.720
has arranged the meeting you requested

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.070
at HSBC.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.980
By then,

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.790
Mr. Qiao Renyu

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.330
will also be waiting for you

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.530
in his former office.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:16.510
Yinwan,

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:18.310
what are you doing?

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.190
All you ever do is make me wait

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.690
and wait and wait,

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.260
and tell me to take the long view.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.720
But no one cares

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.270
how my brother is,

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:26.940
whether he is alive,

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.140
or whether he's hurt.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:29.910
Indeed,

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:31.810
it proves

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.920
I can only rely on myself.

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.350
You'll get yourself in danger.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.150
You cannot go.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.290
Who are you to tell me what to do?

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.200
Please tell Mr. Yazaki

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.390
I will be there on time.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.050
Yinwan,

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.870
have you really made up your mind?

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:03.740
I have.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:13.040
I'm sorry.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.300
I didn't have time
to discuss with you before.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.040
When I went to the Sawa Agency
to request seeing my brother,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.370
I wasn't very confident they would agree.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.550
So I planned
to wait until things became clearer

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.280
before discussing it with you.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:26.930
But by stepping into this,

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.650
you'll be putting yourself
in the most dangerous position.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.050
This is the only way we can see my brother

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.490
and obtain the intelligence
about the banknote paper,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.150
isn't it?

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.150
Since you've made up your mind,

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:46.320
we'll support you

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.550
and carry out the plan together.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.250
As for the subsequent security issues,

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.850
we'll figure something out.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.660
Mr. Qiao holds such a big secret.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.140
The Japanese
would never relax their guard over him.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.400
So why did they suddenly agree

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.850
to let Miss Qiao see him?

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.770
There's only one possibility:

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.500
Mr. Qiao still hasn't revealed

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.380
the secret

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:08.270
of the banknote paper,

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.360
so the Japanese

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.760
have run out of options.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.720
We always assumed

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.790
that with their brutal methods,

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.400
Mr. Qiao would surely break down.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.190
But we didn't expect someone
who looks so frail

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.920
to be this tough.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.080
Since Mr. Qiao

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.420
endured torture and still refused to talk,

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.870
and Yinwan
is the person he cares about most,

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.090
would he really reveal the intelligence?

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.060
After all, if he talks,

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.710
he'd be pushing Yinwan into danger.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.680
I'll find a way to convince him.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.670
I believe my brother

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.950
will make the right choice.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.420
But...

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.140
how can we pass such a big secret

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.740
right under the enemy's nose

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.630
without showing any flaws?

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.240
Even if we really manage to do it,

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.740
the enemy won't let Yinwan

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.510
walk away with it.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.270
Everyone, listen to me.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.510
I've already thought this through.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.800
I suddenly demanded to see my brother,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.350
so the Japanese
were bound to find it suspicious.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.440
Even if they don't get anything definite

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.610
from our conversation,

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.470
they will certainly have doubts.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.090
But just as Dr. Ke said,

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.450
now that they've run out of options
with my brother,

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.110
they can only work through me.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:37.650
And that

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.050
is my opportunity.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.010
I bet they will let me go,

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.230
then closely monitor me

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.010
to follow the trail

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.610
and find the banknote paper.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.530
I agree with Yinwan's assessment.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.020
But in the current situation,

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.010
surveillance will be everywhere.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:01.440
Any conventional method

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.300
will be detected by the enemy.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.870
We need a way

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.520
they can't possibly anticipate,

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.100
see through, or detect,

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.650
so that Yinwan

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.900
can pass the information out safely.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.010
I have an idea.

It's very pretty.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.260
why don't you two siblings

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:55.010
talk in private?

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.120
Renyu.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:15.960
Renyu?

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.070
Renyu?

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.730
Renyu,

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.010
it's me, Yinwan.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.360
Renyu?

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.360
Renyu, what happened to you?

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.030
Renyu.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:28.400
Look at me, Renyu.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.390
It's me, Yinwan.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.520
Renyu!

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:31.580
It's me, Yinwan.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.220
Is Qiao Renyu really insane,

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:42.330
or is he pretending?

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.240
Keep listening.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.720
I'm Yinwan!

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:51.420
Renyu!

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.770
Moonlight shines

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:09.790
on the threshing floor.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:16.210
Little one, be good and go to sleep.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:19.940
Moonlight shines

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:23.190
on the threshing floor.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:30.230
Little one, be good and go to sleep.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:37.320
Tomorrow Mom has rice shoots
to plant so deep,

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:43.150
and Granddad takes the buffalo
up the hill to keep.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.630
On the threshing floor.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:58.100
Little one, be good and go to sleep.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:06.130
Tomorrow Mom has rice shoots
to plant so deep,

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:13.800
and Granddad takes the buffalo
up the hill to keep.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:20.850
Renyu.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:23.440
Yinwan?

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.270
I'm here, Renyu.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.790
What are you doing here?

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.150
Didn't I tell you to leave?

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.670
I wanted to see you, Renyu.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.630
I didn't know how you were doing.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.980
Didn't you call me a traitor?

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.410
Is it worth taking such a big risk?

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.030
Renyu,

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.310
I know

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.990
that whatever decision you made,

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.480
whatever you did,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.720
you must have had no choice.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.800
There had to be something

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.020
more important

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.900
than your reputation, even your life,

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.590
tying your hands

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.650
and making you work for the Japanese.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.260
This

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.140
is related to HSBC,

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:33.910
right?

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.840
They arrested all the HSBC employees
and their families

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.770
and are executing them one by one.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:02.620
I'm sorry, Renyu.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.020
I slapped you last time.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:06.820
Does it still hurt?

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.150
Let's not talk about it.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.650
It's in the past.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.440
It's in the past.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.000
Look at you.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.930
You've lost weight.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.090
Too bad we're not at home.

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.810
Otherwise I'd cook you a good meal

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.570
to help you regain your strength.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.090
Speaking of food,

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.010
I'm getting a bit hungry myself.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:45.940
How about

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.670
we get something to eat?

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:49.830
Mm-hmm.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.710
Tell the General

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:58.400
I want an apple pie.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.470
A large one.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.130
Apple pie?
