[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.710
[Episode 21]

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.680
Did you see the Luminous Pearl

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.810
that night?

00:01:58.759 --> 00:01:59.570
Yes, I did.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.960
So

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.570
when the explosion happened,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.450
you didn't...

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.760
I'm not a god.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.930
I'm just an ordinary person too.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.760
What do you mean?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.030
You saved me.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.520
Were you hurt?

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.850
Let me see.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.850
I'm fine.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.910
How is your mother?

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.590
Chris has arranged
a second surgery for her.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.170
It went fairly well,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.890
but I'll have to go

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.150
and see her in person to know for sure.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.130
You should go back soon.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.320
When people are sick,

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.140
they need their family by their side.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:43.870
I'm sorry.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.360
I even asked you before

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.170
if you wanted to go to Nanjing together.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.370
I never thought I'd be the one
who couldn't make it.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.120
We'll have plenty of time in the future.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.780
But your mom can't wait.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.320
After major surgery,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.730
a patient's mood is
the most important thing.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.970
If you stay with her,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.490
she'll feel better.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.100
It's good for her recovery.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.570
Are you...

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.040

Officer Lu just left.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.100
He left when I arrived.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.490
My phone.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.080
I'm planning to leave Manshi.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.240
Maybe I'll go somewhere far away
to try my luck.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.490
I won't be using this phone number
and this WeChat account anymore.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.550
Once I've settled down in a new place,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.090
I'll contact you again.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.050
Sanlai.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.460
Tomorrow...

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.170
help me cancel my phone number.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.280
Brandy,

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.660
isn't this too cruel to Jiang Mu?

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.380
Cancel it.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.800
Happy birthday,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.110
Zhao.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.940
Mu's presence lingers everywhere here.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040
Her laughter

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.700
still seems to ring in my ears.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.140
But I have to say goodbye to all of this.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.370
I...

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.820
I can't become a burden to her.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.590
As long as she's happy,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.800
that's all that matters.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.580
You've really decided to go back to China?

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.090
I'll go back to school first,

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.610
then see what I can build from there.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.730
Can you really bear to
leave the garage behind?

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.780
I said back then,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.610
once the matter with Wan's was settled,

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.610
I'd close it down.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:51.760
I know.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.880
By that time, you were already planning to
take Jiang Mu with you.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560
Once you leave,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.430
our brotherhood will really be over.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.260
It won't be over.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.890
You two will come visit me
in China, won't you?

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:10.490
Alright.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.290
Make something of yourself.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.690
When you're successful,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.220
we'll come leech off you.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:17.850
It's a deal, then.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.180
Pick up the pace.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.440
Mu will be here soon.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:36.810
Don't rush me,

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.330
or I'll cut my hand.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.450
You have a comeback for everything I say.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.510
Hurry up and think.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.570
When Mu comes later,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.090
if she asks about Zhao,

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.440
what should we tell her?

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.280
Just say Jin Zhao went away
to look for better opportunities

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.370
and never came back.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.730
Fine, fine, say it like that!

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.090
What if she asks about

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.680
his address or phone number?

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.280
What then?

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.560
Just say we don't have them either,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.360
and that he hasn't contacted us.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.370
Do you even have a brain?

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.970
That obviously won't work.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:07.250
Mom.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.330
You think she'd buy that...

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.900
I bought Mu's favorite

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.920
strawberry milkshake.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.560
Good.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:13.730
Xin,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.010
when Mu comes,

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.090
be careful what you say.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.280
If she asks about Zhao,

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.210
just say,

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:22.770
"I don't know.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.160
I don't know anything."

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.680
Okay?

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.520
That's lying.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.760
You're just a child. What do you know?

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.680
Take this over there.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.740
I know everything.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.130
You and Dad are just being cruel.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.260
Did you hear that? Even our child says so.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.730
Tell me—are we being

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:44.740
cruel here?

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.490
Isn't it all for their own good?

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.070
Mrs. Zhao, did Jin Zhao
ever come back later?

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:01.920
No.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.250
Before heading out to make his own way,

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.780
he came back home for a meal.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.660
At that time, he told your dad that

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.130
if

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.960
he managed to settle down over there,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.810
he might never come back.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.450
"Settled down?"

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.630
What do you mean?

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.870
Is he abandoning this family?

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:28.200
Well...

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:34.400
Mu,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.240
he's not your father's
biological son, after all.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.540
All these years he's lived alone outside,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.230
precisely because he didn't want us to...

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.210
didn't want us to
worry too much about him.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.400
So,

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.740
whatever ideas he has,
or whatever decisions he makes,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.590
we...

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.330
have no position to influence him.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.540
Mrs. Zhao, I'm going out for a while.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.140
Don't wait for me for dinner.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.250
Sanlai,

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.160
you closed your pet shop?

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.640
Jiang Mu,

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.320
weren't you studying in Canada?

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.220
You're back in Manshi now?

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.510
Do you have any news about Jin Zhao?

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.520
Brandy?

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.400
I haven't been in contact with him
for a long time either.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.730
That rascal.
Who knows where he ran off to?

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.650
Not even a word to his own buddy!

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.580
Stop looking for him. That rascal.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.310
Just forget about him already.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.660
Aren't there many

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.490
handsome blonde, blue-eyed guys in Canada?

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.010
You should get to know some.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.010
They're definitely better than
that rascal, Brandy.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:02.830
[Three years later]

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.300
You live in Beijing, right?

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:11.510
Yeah, I live in Beijing.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.660
It's cold there.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:13.730
Come on.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:15.640
Come on, welcome.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.430
Thank you very much.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.369
-Merry Christmas.
-Here comes the fish!

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.530
Merry Christmas.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.329
Cheers.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:23.880
Mu.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:25.869
This is wonderful.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.200
Thank you so much for all of this, Mu.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.490
This Christmas feels especially nice.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.490
Thank you for joining us,

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.330
and I'm thankful that your mom

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:35.660
has recovered well.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.530
I'll go get her.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.090
Eat more later,

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:39.930
okay?

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.130
Come on, Nick.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.130
Keep her company, will you?

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:42.680
Okay.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.600
Mu, did you make
all these dishes yourself?

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.500
Did you cook often before?

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.440
Would you believe me if I said

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.680
I'd never cooked a complete meal
before coming here?

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.650
This is incredibly delicious.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.090
People,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.480
they never stay the same.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.560
You should get her number.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.340
Hey, I would like to say, like...

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:30.350
Sorry.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.810
I'd like... I want to...

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.360
Can I have your number or some...

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.080
Bro, no.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.800
Bro.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.920
Mu,

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:54.330
I ground this coffee myself.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:55.790
Would you like to try some?

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.480
No, thanks.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.610
Why do you never drink

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.010
the coffee I make for you?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.640
I'm just afraid that
if I drink too much coffee,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.440
I won't be able to sleep at night.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.890
I'm meeting a few friends later.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.310
Would you like to join?

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.160
Alright.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.530
Actually, there aren't any friends.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.400
It's just me.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.570
Why do you reject me

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.930
every time I ask you out?

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.720
Can't you give me a chance?

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.720
Nick, I've noticed your Chinese

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.050
has gotten really good.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.290
But I'm sorry,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.050
I have to turn you down again.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.960
Mu, you're so heartless.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.240
Fine then,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.680
I'll drink it myself.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.810
You know that, uh,
Character A in the game?

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.370
My proficiency is through the roof.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:54.750
Do you want a go?

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.490
I can give you a hand
and show you how it's done.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.800
And you know what?

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.720
Now they've got so many competitions
with a lot of prize money as well.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.130
So, you never know. I could be rich.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.890
At the riverbank,
I caught the biggest fish, really.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.400
I was around there every morning,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.240
from six to four to six, all clock.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.200
From four to six, I am...

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.860
I was waiting and waiting.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.610
I'm telling you,

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.050
that basketball game the other day

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.510
almost gave me a heart attack.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.430
First, we were up by so many points,

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:28.960
but then, towards the middle of the game,
ultimately, I chucked a three-pointer.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.960
Causing us to win!
Putting a victory for our team!

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.860
Have a sip of coffee if you want.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.680
Is this coffee good?

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.460
It's probably not as good as
the one I make, right?

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.810
The taste of my coffee...

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.450
Do you still remember it?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.590
Why is it sweet?

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.410
I won't let you have bitter things.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:55.720
I remember.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.410
By the way, I've got a basketball game
tomorrow. Do you want to come?

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.170
Sorry.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.350
I'm tired.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.740
You should go out
and see more of the world.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.090
Maybe you'll find

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.650
there are many men out there
better than me.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.530
See?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.610
I'm already 26 years old.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:36.970
After all these years

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:38.850
of drifting and crossing paths

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.180
with countless people,

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:42.530
I still can't forget you.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.460
By the way, I'm from Nanjing.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.280
I did my undergraduate studies

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.450
at Nanjing University
of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.360
NUAA?

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.720
I once wanted to study at NUAA too.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.640
But somehow, one thing led to another,

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.970
and I ended up in Canada.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.850
Really?

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.570
We have quite a connection then.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:05.960
We're even in the same field
for graduate studies.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.160
We should talk more about our research.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.290
Hey there.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.030
You're so dedicated.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.360
The pride of our nation.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:52.960
Thank you.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.950
May I take a look?

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:20.200
Are you into fountain pens?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.960
A little bit.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.740
A gift from a friend?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.420
From my ex-boyfriend.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.640
You must've dated for quite a while.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.330
A week.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.550
A week, and he gave you a pen like this?

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.200
An 18K gold nib,

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.640
and the barrel and cap

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.240
are pure silver with engravings.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.570
This is quite a nice pen.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.960
Your ex must've been pretty rich.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.140
He didn't have money.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.920
He just gave me the best thing he had

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.790
when he was at his lowest point.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.820
That house was quite magical.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.240
The appliances were always breaking down,

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.290
one after another,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.200
as if they'd planned it together.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.260
Jin Zhao always had no choice
but to go back and fix them.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.960
Your dad is good at driving

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.810
but not much else.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:23.090
Being with him

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.160
is exhausting.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.340
That's not true.
His cooking is actually very good.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.090
At least better than Jin Zhao's cooking.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.340
Jin Zhao can cook too?

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.070
Yes.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.660
Not only can he cook,

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.160
but he can also box, drive,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.240
and fix cars.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.990
And repair home appliances too.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.640
Yes,

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:46.590
he can do just about anything.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.810
Although he was constantly framed
by Wan's,

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.370
he never gave up

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:57.990
or felt sorry for himself.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:59.290
In my opinion,

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.900
he's a person
with a strong sense of justice.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.540
What is he doing now?

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.160
I don't know.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.880
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.480
The weather is so cool today.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.140
So after school, do you have any plans?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.050
Maybe we can take a walk.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.770
Fine.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.260
That sounds good.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.400
Jiang Mu.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.370
What are you doing here?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.680
Thank you.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.850
You're welcome.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.370
I'm here for work,

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.030
on assignment for a collaborative project.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.190
After graduation,

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.890
you really did go to Nanjing.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.570
Now you're at a branch of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences?

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.610
I've been to many places,

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:56.540
but I still think

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:58.250
our hometown is the best.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.480
I spend most of my time
at the Purple Mountain Observatory now.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.130
That's where the asteroid "China"
was discovered.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.790
They've achieved outstanding
research results in recent years.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.200
That's great.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.050
I'm really envious.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.640
I haven't had a chance

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.000
to visit the old observatory site
on the mountain to see the gnomon,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.290
armillary sphere, and other ancient
astronomical instruments.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:18.490
When do you graduate?

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.410
Soon, just a few more months.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.370
I happen to have

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.770
a research assistant position open.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.900
Are you interested?

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.180
I could save it for you.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200
I...

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.640
No rush.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.960
You still have several months
until graduation.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.420
Think about it carefully.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:38.450
By the way,

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.810
there's a small gathering here tomorrow.

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.870
It's with colleagues who came with me

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.420
and some local peers.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.720
Why don't

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:46.820
you come too?

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.930
I can introduce you around.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:49.540
Okay.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.680
Sorry, everyone, I'm late.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:14.400
Jiang Mu.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.810
Zhijie, aren't you going to introduce us?

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:17.920
Allow me to introduce you all.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.450
This is my junior, Jiang Mu.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.370
Nice to meet you.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:21.300
Nice to meet you.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.370
This is my supervisor,

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:23.890
Professor Gan.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:24.810
Nice to meet you, Professor.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.240
And these two are my colleagues
from the CAS.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.100
Those over there are my classmates
from Melbourne.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.150
Come on, have a seat.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:31.720
Hurry.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:33.480
Sit here.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.090
Come on, cheers.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.270
Mu, welcome to this gathering.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.550
Thank you, Professor.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.130
What's your field of study?

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.800
I'm studying astronomy.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.990
Not many girls
study this field these days.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.480
That is...

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.900
an exquisite die with a red bean heart?

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.570
The agate within the jade die is

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.960
carved into the shape
of red beans—love beans.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.730
This kind of hollow carving
with a red bean

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.890
inserted inside

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.530
makes all six sides appear red—

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.290
that's what we call
"an exquisite die with a red bean heart."

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.880
A symbol of deep longing.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.250
In ancient times, it was a token of love.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.850
It was popular for a while back then.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.290
Rarely seen nowadays.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:22.410
Very special.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.110
You're giving it to me?

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.260
Now you're willing to give it to me?

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.700
Before, no matter how I asked,
you wouldn't give it to me.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.700
So stingy.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.290
I really couldn't give it to you before.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:36.880
But now...

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.750
Now why can you?

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:45.350
I'd have to start
with the origin of this thing.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.640
I'll tell you about it slowly
in the future.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:04.330
I've tried to see the world.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.130
All these years,

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.640
I've met many excellent people.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:10.810
But no one

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.180
can make me feel anything.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.290
Because

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:18.000
none of them is you.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.200
Mom,

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.770
I want to go back to China for my career.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.570
Back to Nanjing.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.130
Senior!

00:30:47.131 --> 00:31:07.535
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.190
Jiang Mu.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.850
What is it?

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.440
You mentioned yesterday
that you need a research assistant.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.240
Is that true?

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.810
Of course it's true.

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.640
You've decided so quickly?

00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.680
Yes.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.660
I'll go back as soon as I graduate.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.850
Didn't you say your family was here

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.000
and you weren't planning to go back?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.860
I am going back.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.810
I also want to contribute to
our country's aerospace program,

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.270
even if it's just a little.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.570
Alright.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.690
I'll contact them for you right away.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:20.330
Dad.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.050
Dad, Dad.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.850
Look, I've finished my homework.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.160
You promised

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.770
to take me to the concert.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.610
Did I ever promise you that?

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:30.570
Yes, you did.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.290
You can't break your promise.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.490
Why don't I remember?

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.130
Your dad said he would,
so he won't break his promise.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.930
Come on, sit down. Food's ready.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.720
Mom,

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.280
you have to back me up.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.410
I know. Now sit down.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.330
Mu, come on.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:46.640
Try my cooking

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.250
and see if I've improved.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.460
Has there been any news

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.620
from Jin Zhao?

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.130
He sends money back,

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.820
but he himself has never come back.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.770
We haven't heard much from him
in a long time.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.480
Yes,

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:08.950
he hasn't come back for so many years.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.960
Who knows,

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:13.100
maybe he's already
settled down somewhere else.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:15.810
Right?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.630
Eat up.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.100
Have some more.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.480
Have some more.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:36.610
Thank you.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:41.850
Seriously, how long did it take you
to pass the exam?

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.970
I got in the second year after you left.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:44.920
I've already graduated

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.370
and returned home
to take over the family business.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.680
I'm working as a purchasing manager
at my dad's factory.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.540
I'm doing pretty well for myself.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.120
I can see that.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:53.710
What about you?

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.360
How have you been lately?

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.130
Oh, right!

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.160
I always thought

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.000
you and Brandy were related.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.330
I kept quiet about it for years

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.050
and never dared to say anything.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.330
It wasn't until last year,
when Brandy came back, that I realized

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.640
you two aren't actually related by blood.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.680
He came back?

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:12.330
When?

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:14.240
Early last year.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.130
There was a problem with a shipment
at my dad's factory.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.960
I couldn't find a replacement anywhere.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.760
Then I got a call from a stranger.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:21.920
He said he had the goods

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.720
and quoted me a price

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.850
lower than the market average.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.160
I thought it was a scam,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.090
so I insisted on meeting in person.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.200
To my surprise,

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.640
it was Brandy!

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:39.790
How is he doing?

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.770
I'm not really sure

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:43.370
how he's doing now.

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.160
I offered to take him out for a meal

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.290
to properly thank him that day.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.800
But he said he was short on time

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.680
and that he could only stay for one day.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.840
He helped us connect with new suppliers

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.040
and left the next day.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.600
Oh, right.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.890
I remember he brought someone
with him that day,

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:57.780
called him "Boss,"

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.780
and was very respectful toward him.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.810
Then... how was

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:08.850
his health?

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:11.730
He looked worn out.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.810
Probably tired from traveling.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.730
But he was still as handsome as ever.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:17.460
He hasn't lost his charm at all.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.630
It was precisely because of the time

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.650
when Brandy helped me turn things around

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.909
that I was finally able

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.770
to establish my authority
at my dad's factory

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.040
and gain some real influence.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.300
No one called me a nepotism hire anymore.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.960
Later, I found out

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.400
why Brandy suddenly contacted me.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.250
Why?

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:41.940
Do you remember

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.670
when you brought Brandy

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.600
to my dad's factory to fix the car?

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.230
At that time, Brandy told me

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.580
he owed me a favor

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.080
and would repay it someday.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.210
I thought he was just being polite.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.920
I had completely forgotten about it.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:58.960
I never expected him to remember
after all these years!

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.560
I really respect him
for being a man of his word!

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.370
Cheers.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.820
He even remembered the favor
he owed to Pan Kai,

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.960
so why did he promise to contact me

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.710
but never follow through?

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.330
Do you have his contact information?

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.520
Could you share it with me?

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.520
You don't have it?

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:27.020
I'll send it to you. I'll send it to you.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.320
I've sent it to you.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:33.440
He came back last year.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:34.980
His family is here,

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.440
so there's no reason
he wouldn't go see Dad.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.480
He's not a heartless person.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.400
Back when things were so difficult,

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.560
he even risked breaking the law to
modify cars to help pay for Xin's surgery

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.890
and support the family.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.000
There's no way
he would just disappear forever

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.400
after the case was over.

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.890
But why would Dad say

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.520
he hasn't come home for several years?

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.810
It's also possible

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.640
that he did come back,

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.480
but for some reason,

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.250
Dad chose to hide it from me.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.760
But what reason could Dad possibly have

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.080
for doing that?

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.890
Dad, I'm already on the plane.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.810
Take care of yourself and Mrs. Zhao.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:16.040
When Xin's on holiday,

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.480
bring her to Nanjing for a visit.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.040
Okay.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.570
Have a safe journey.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.170
Let me know when you land.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.040
She's boarded the plane.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.190
Do you think...

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.640
she's found out we lied to her?

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.560
Probably not.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.180
Did she ask you about Zhao in private?

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.070
Mu is such a good girl.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.860
Is it okay for us to lie to her like that?

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.860
This was Jin Zhao's decision.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.360
I feel so uneasy...

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.940
But this is all we can do for now.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.210
Brother, I want strawberries!

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.690
Zhao.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.750
I'm back.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:53.250
Do you remember?

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.210
This is where we grew up together.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.960
I told you before—

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.690
when I was little,

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.440
I'd secretly come back to our old house

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.370
and leave my contact information,

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:06.400
hoping that one day, when you returned,

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.480
you could find me.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.770
At that time, I had a hope

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.330
that as long as you came back,

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.380
maybe you'd use the same method

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.860
to leave me some messages.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.210
So I could find you too.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.360
But...

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.420
Zhao, look.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.720
Everything here has changed.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.380
Changed so much
I don't even recognize it anymore.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.360
Zhao,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:33.950
can I still find you?

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.600
Where are you really?

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.870
Are we really going to
miss each other like this?

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:42.850
Should I really...

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.190
let you go?
