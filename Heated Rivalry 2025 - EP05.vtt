- What?
- Yo, chill out, man.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.549
I know you text
some girl named Lily.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:08.883

You're in love with him.</i>

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.900

- Fuck!

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.405

- No!

a huge fucking movie star.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:33.742

to my hotel for my pickup.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.656
- Right.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.745
Listen, uh,
about last night, I...

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.497
- It's fine.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:22.665
I think this season
is stressing me out

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:23.666
more than usual.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.086

this week.

00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:27.670
Maybe just the two of us?

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.172

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:33.343

there any openly gay players?

gay players or whatever,

said it publicly.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.991
maybe I'm not doing it for you?

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.242
- Yes, you are.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.327

- Yeah.

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.538

of course I do. Sorry.

maybe you'd rather be kissing...

I like talking with you.
I like being with you.

I like all of it.

I know the sex stuff
is a problem, but...

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.295
- It's not a problem.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.756
A problem is
something you can fix.

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:44.719

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.104
And it's really fine.

I just don't think
that we can keep trying.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:04.781

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.909
I think, um...

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:13.039
I think, uh...

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.584
- Hey, you don't owe me
any explanation.

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:19.629
- I feel like I kind of do.
- You really don't.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.888
Can I ask if you've ever
been with another guy?

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:41.984
Have you ever told
anyone that before?

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:48.157
Was it different with a guy?

00:06:52.078 --> 00:06:53.996
- Of course.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.706
- Was it better?

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:03.381
Yeah, it was, uh...

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.091
Um...

00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.717
It was better.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.763

(Chuckling)

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.102

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.771

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:23.693
any gay boyfriend of mine

- Oh, you've had other...

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.697
- Oh, I was in theater school.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:30.324
Like, 70% of my boyfriends
have left me for other guys.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.368
- 70%?
- Actually, 80%.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:33.369
(Chuckling)

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:34.745

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:35.872
- Wow.

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:37.748
(Both chuckling)

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.877

back on Instagram.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:42.044

but I just need to sort
some things out first.

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.052
- Of course.

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:56.142
- And I was kidding about Miles,
but he totally would.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:57.727
Like, in a heartbeat.

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:05.318
- You haven't said anything
to him, have you?

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.527
- No, definitely not.

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:08.738

Not some bullshit,
"Let's stay friends," thing.

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.717
Let's be real friends.

00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:35.890
You're secretly one of
the funniest guys I know.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.309
- Well, that secret,
you don't have to keep.

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:39.936
- Oh, I will tell everyone.

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:45.024
I have a feeling that
there's not a lot of people

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:46.275
you can talk to.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:50.071
I mean about all
the other things and stuff.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:53.074
- Things and stuff
can be tricky for me.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.039
- Text me whenever, OK?

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:03.209
I mean it, because I will be
texting you all the time.

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:04.460
- Promise.

00:09:04.585 --> 00:09:06.045

- Since when did you
start smoking again?

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.619
- I haven't started again.

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.496
Just every once in a while.

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:44.834

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.170
- Especially ones that
put good Russian players

00:09:48.337 --> 00:09:50.089
on the second shift
of the power play

00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:52.592
so mediocre Canadian players
can waste a minute and a half

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:53.843
with the man advantage.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.845
- Mediocre? Matheson?

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.889
- Yes. You can quote me.

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.101
- When I see him
at the all-star game.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.354
- So embarrassing
that he's playing.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:09.317
- The people voted.
They love him.

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.694

00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:17.033
You're playing on the same team
as Hollander this year, right?

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:19.619
- Is he also mediocre?

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:23.581
- No, he's amazing. Those hands.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.374
And he's gorgeous.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:27.376
- If you say so.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:33.424
What?

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:37.053
- You know he's gorgeous.
And you know he's good.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.722
- He's very good.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:44.226
- I would love to see you
on a line with him.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:47.063
- Not sure he can play wing.

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:48.397
- But you can.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.278
- You would have him center me?

Rose Landry will bring.

Completely.

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:06.682

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:10.852

To me, at least.

but this fucking your arch-rival
is another thing.

I am sorry about last time, OK?

00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:09.411
it was nice.

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:16.543
- And it felt like
we were something.

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:19.838
- We can't be
something, Hollander.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.762
- Would you want to be,
if we could?

00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:28.347
- We can't.

00:22:29.431 --> 00:22:31.058

00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:33.435

00:22:34.394 --> 00:22:36.438

00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:37.939
I don't like you anymore.

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:38.982

00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:44.613
I think I like you
maybe a little too much.

00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:46.406
- Don't. Don't fucking
do this, Hollander.

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:47.866

- I don't want to find out.

00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:12.474
- But would your parents...

00:23:13.975 --> 00:23:17.896

My brother is police.

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:21.191

00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:22.776

00:32:24.692 --> 00:32:26.527
- Stop, Ilya! Stop.

00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:29.322
He's not worth it.
He's not worth anything.

00:32:38.623 --> 00:32:40.541
(Breathing heavily)

00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:43.002
- You can have my apartment.

00:32:43.753 --> 00:32:46.255
And there will be a trust
for my niece.

00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:50.385
She can have it when she's 18.

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:57.141
And you will never,
ever contact me again.

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:01.896
If you do, I will use every
piece of my fame and money

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.692
and notoriety to make sure
that you can't show your face

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.110
in this fucking city

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:10.279
without someone
wanting to break it open.

00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:15.994
So take what I offer,

00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:20.081
shut your fucking mouth
and walk away.

00:33:52.947 --> 00:33:54.782
I don't deserve you.

00:33:55.616 --> 00:33:56.784
- Yes, you do.

00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:59.454
But you don't want me.

00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:04.292
- You know I love you.

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.252
- I know you do.

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:10.381
But it's not the same
as it is with Jane, is it?

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.844
I love you too.

00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:17.722
And whatever you need,
I'll be here.

00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:19.307
I'm not going anywhere.

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:25.772
I just hope Jane
knows how lucky he is.

00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:52.673
- Hey, I'm just gonna...

00:34:52.799 --> 00:34:53.758
- (Hayden): Have fun!

00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:02.683
(Phone vibrating)

00:35:04.977 --> 00:35:07.146
(Vibrating continues)

00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:15.196
- How are you?

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:17.949
- <i>OK.</i>

00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:19.659
<i>Not good.</i>

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:21.369
<i>Probably bad.</i>

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.330
- How's your, uh, family?

00:35:24.455 --> 00:35:25.832
- <i>At their worst.</i>

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.584
My brother is...

00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:31.712
I don't know. Scared.

00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:34.882
It makes him terrible.

00:35:36.008 --> 00:35:38.261
And it makes me terrible back.

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:41.931
- Is it very upsetting?

00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:43.391
- <i>Yes.</i>

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:47.061
<i>But maybe I'm upset</i>

00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:48.855
about the wrong thing.

00:35:50.523 --> 00:35:52.525
- <i>You mean not your father?</i>

00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:56.779
- Maybe...

00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.699
I...

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:02.827
I wish it could be different.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.455
I wish he could know me, or...

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:09.250
(Inhaling deeply, exhaling)

00:36:09.375 --> 00:36:11.335
I don't know. I don't know.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.713
English is too hard right now.

00:36:14.755 --> 00:36:16.841
- <i>I wish I spoke Russian.</i>

00:36:16.966 --> 00:36:18.259
- Mmm.

00:36:18.384 --> 00:36:20.970
Yeah, you could probably
learn it in a week.

00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:23.431
No accent. Perfect.

00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:25.266
<i>Bonjour.</i>

00:36:25.433 --> 00:36:27.310
- That's French, Ilya.

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:29.937
- <i>Yeah, I know, Shane.</i>

00:36:31.147 --> 00:36:32.607
- Where are you?

00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:34.984
- <i>I'm just walking.</i>

00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:36.903
I needed to get out.

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.571
(Sniffling)

00:36:38.696 --> 00:36:41.157
- <i>Hey, uh, I have an idea.</i>

00:36:42.408 --> 00:36:45.203
<i>How about you tell me
everything that's on your mind,</i>

00:36:45.328 --> 00:36:46.704
<i>but in Russian?</i>

00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:49.707
I won't understand,
but maybe it'll help.

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:54.212
- <i>OK.</i>

00:36:55.129 --> 00:36:56.923
(Inhaling deeply)

00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:04.513
<i>I never want to
come back here again.</i>

00:37:07.099 --> 00:37:09.310
<i>I fucking hate it here.</i>

00:37:10.853 --> 00:37:12.897
<i>And they all fucking hate me.</i>

00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:16.442
I pay for everything.

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:20.029
I make sure everyone
has clothes they like.

00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:22.907
I make sure the food is perfect,

00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:26.661
that Father is buried
next to his parents,

00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:31.666
that the tomb is perfect.

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.669
And the only fucking word
I ever hear is:

00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:36.587
"I want more, Ilya.

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:41.509
I need more, Ilya,
more, more, more!"

00:37:42.009 --> 00:37:44.679
And I have nothing
for these people!

00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:47.431
I give them everything...

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:50.726
but I feel fucking empty.

00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:54.355
<i>They don't care.</i>

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:59.443
<i>They look at me and they
see a bank. Or an enemy.</i>

00:37:59.568 --> 00:38:01.529
<i>Or I don't even know what.</i>

00:38:03.698 --> 00:38:09.537
My brother, he always hated me.

00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:14.500
And I know why, but...

00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:19.380
it kills me.

00:38:25.886 --> 00:38:29.890
And it kills me that he took
care of my father and I didn't.

00:38:36.188 --> 00:38:37.857
But I couldn't!

00:38:38.941 --> 00:38:40.693
I wasn't here.

00:38:42.862 --> 00:38:45.072
<i>I still paid for it all.</i>

00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:48.451
<i>And he will never forgive me.</i>

00:38:48.951 --> 00:38:50.536
<i>For any of it.</i>

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:52.413
<i>For existing.</i>

00:38:54.373 --> 00:38:57.335
And it means.

00:38:59.587 --> 00:39:01.672
I have no one now.

00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:08.804
Well, not no one. I have...

00:39:10.973 --> 00:39:12.516
Svetlana.

00:39:16.395 --> 00:39:18.105
She loves me.

00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:20.900
And I love her.

00:39:22.943 --> 00:39:24.612
But not like...

00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:30.993
Fuck me.

00:39:44.465 --> 00:39:46.592
But not like I love you.

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:51.472
That's the worst fucking part
of all this is...

00:39:53.516 --> 00:39:55.559
that all I want is you.

00:39:56.352 --> 00:39:58.145
It's always you.

00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:02.691
I'm so in love with you,

00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:05.611
and I don't know
what to do about it.

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.081
<i>OK, I'm done.</i>

00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:22.378
- Do you feel better?

00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:23.879
- <i>Yes.</i>

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:26.507
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:31.345
- Maybe you could
teach me Russian someday.

00:40:31.512 --> 00:40:33.681
- <i>Yeah. OK.</i>

00:40:33.806 --> 00:40:35.349
<i>Only useful phrases.</i>

00:40:35.474 --> 00:40:36.684
- Like what?

00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:38.394
- <i>I don't know, like:</i>

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:40.855
<i>"Harder, please. Yes, sir."</i>

00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:42.523
- Fuck you.

00:40:42.648 --> 00:40:45.192
- <i>No, more like:
"Fuck me, please."</i>

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.615
- How about...

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.034
<i>"I wish you were here
right now"?</i>

00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:02.168
- I wish I was too.

It's mostly an act.

Are you OK?

00:44:42.888 --> 00:44:45.766

a fractured collarbone.

00:44:45.891 --> 00:44:47.935
Out for the playoffs, but...

00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:50.896
- Could have been worse.
- Could have been worse.

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.523

He did not mean to hurt you.

text you last night.

I'm mostly mad at Marleau
for fucking that up.

00:45:34.106 --> 00:45:36.150
- He feels really bad.

00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:40.404

00:45:41.447 --> 00:45:43.323

if you just rest now.

- Hollander...

00:45:45.284 --> 00:45:48.203
- Will you come
to my cottage this summer?

00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:50.664
Don't go to Russia.

00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:52.332
Come to my house.

00:45:52.458 --> 00:45:53.917
We'll have so much fun.

00:45:54.042 --> 00:45:55.919
It's so private.
No one will know.

00:45:56.044 --> 00:45:58.005
- Hollander, you know
I can't do that.

00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:00.340
- We could have
a week or even two.

00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:03.677
We'd be completely alone.

00:46:03.844 --> 00:46:05.387

You're not gonna

00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:19.610

00:47:25.717 --> 00:47:27.719
- <i>More than I already have.</i>

00:47:27.845 --> 00:47:29.137

00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:31.557
And then they'd have
to keep my secret.

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:33.433

about Labor Day weekend.

00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:48.949

- Am I right?

00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:18.687
And good for Scott Hunter.

00:48:18.812 --> 00:48:20.314

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.149

It's his year.

- How can you possibly
know that?

00:48:24.276 --> 00:48:26.111
