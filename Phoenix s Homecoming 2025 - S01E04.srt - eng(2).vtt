=Phoenix's Homecoming=

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.976
=Episode 4=

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.439
So my lady,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.159
will you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.200
have me as your beloved?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.040
No, she won't.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.719
"No, she won't."

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.400
Come on, I'm talking to my lady.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:16.879
Why are you speaking for her?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.159
You don't seem to
have any real business.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.079
In that case,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.719
go back where you came from.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.599
A hundred years of cultivation
to share a bed,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.400
and a thousand years to share a pillow.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:33.879
We've slept together.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.280
Will you talk to me nicely?

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.480
Getting physical the moment you arrive

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.280
is hardly gentlemanly conduct.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.159
(This is far more entertaining
than the operas I watched)

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:48.992
(in Weiyang Palace.)

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:52.280
Grand Tutor,

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.959
most of Su Wei's embezzled money

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.239
ended up in Chancellor Huo's pockets.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.159
Chancellor Huo will try to protect him.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.400
You must send a letter to the palace

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.359
to prevent him from intervening.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.879
This matter is of great importance.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.039
Who should do it?

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:24.360
What?

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.319
Me?

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.560
I'm the Seventeenth Prince of Qi State.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.520
I've never suffered such humiliation.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.800
I'm playing a servant.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.280
These clothes smell sour.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.400
I knew Grand Tutor Xie
couldn't let go of court affairs.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
A mere commoner
still dares to offer counsel.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.479
Commander, what happened?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.240
The decree is unpredictable. You'd
better not inquire about palace matters.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.039
Everyone, open your eyes
and watch carefully.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.000
This is what happens to those
who gossip about the Grand Princess.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.639
Our masters' right and wrong

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.199
are not for us to judge.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.199
Out of the way.

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.272
(Imperial Study)

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.240
Your Majesty, the person is here.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.240
I, a servant of the Xie household,
pay my respects,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.199
Your Majesty.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.120
His Majesty wishes to know

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.439
if the letter submitted
by Lord Xie is truthful.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.560
Lord Xie witnessed

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.520
the people of Zhuozhou

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.319
living in misery.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.520
Governor Su embezzles money
and doesn't...

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.719
He doesn't

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.199
deserve to be an official
of the Chen State.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.399
Regarding Zhuozhou
Governor Su's corruption,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.560
His Majesty fully entrusts
the case to Lord Xie.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.184
Your Majesty.

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.040
My lord

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.680
has something to hand in.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:47.120
Your Majesty.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.240
Your Majesty, be careful.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.319
(I sought a marriage alliance between
Qi and Chen States with Grand Princess.)

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.439
(This young sovereign here)

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.800
(gave me such a hard time.)

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.519
(It seems the bond
between him and his sister)

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.199
(is not ordinary.)

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.720
The Grand Princess
cherished this Phoenix Pendant.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.279
Where did Lord Xie find it?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.600
Your Majesty,

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.120
it was found in Zhuozhou.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.720
Lord Xie was following Governor Su

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.240
and found it

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.079
by chance.

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:41.680
Zhuozhou.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:43.959
Interesting place.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.199
Tell your lord.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.360
Feel free to execute
those who obstruct the investigation.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:50.879
Yes.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.160
Vast is the sky, in dread is the earth.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.720
The land of fish and rice
holds no surplus grain.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.199
Common folk by the roadside,
thin as sticks,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.839
while the Governor's granaries overflow.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.800
Forty thousand taels
sent to the disaster zone,

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.480
yet more silver is hidden
in the Chaohuang Academy.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.279
Strange, oh strange,
the silver plays hide and seek.

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.000
The missing silver

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.040
turns out to be hidden
in the Chaohuang Academy.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.199
Who is trying to set me up?

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.120
Faster, all of you!

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.439
Oh no.

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.519
Governor Su, where are you off to?

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:44.160
Xie Fei.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.480
So it was you.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.839
You set me up!

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.399
What do you mean, Governor Su?

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:51.759
Forget it.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.319
It's still early.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.399
Let's have a chat in prison.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.759
Xie Fei,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.800
you are so despicable.

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.879
Filthy playboy.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.759
You disgust me.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.279
What do you mean, Lord Su?

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:28.399
I'm just a commoner now,

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.360
long removed from court disputes.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:32.560
I only returned to court

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.879
due to His Majesty's trust.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
But the moment

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:40.199
I took office,
you faced false accusations.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:41.680
I...

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.720
I'm in a difficult position.

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:45.439
This...

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:46.560
This has nothing

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:48.120
to do with you?

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.519
So who set me up?

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.519
Well,

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.120
you're asking me?

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.600
I don't know either.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.279
The night is long.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.759
You have plenty of time to think.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.040
However,

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:06.519
I must warn you, Lord Su.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.439
I've heard

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:13.439
that the Zhuozhou prison

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.160
houses many restless spirits.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.800
Lord Su,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.000
be careful at night.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.639
Who are you trying to scare?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:41.960
Who is it?

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.039
Who's crying?

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:50.279
Is Xie Fei actually right about this?

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.960
There are spirits here.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:56.639
Su Wei.

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:00.679
Su Wei.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.519
Don't come any closer.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.480
Stay back.

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.440
Su Wei.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.200
Stay back.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.720
Don't...

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.279
Die now.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:16.639
Stay back, Grand Princess.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.440
Stay back.

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:18.840
It wasn't my fault.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.360
I saw the letters you sent

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.039
to Qi State.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.320
That was your handwriting.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.399
I know even less

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.600
about the Sheng army.

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:26.679
Die now.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.399
Where's my protective amulet?

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:29.840
My prayer beads dropped.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.240
I knew it was a bad omen.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.279
Now I'm seeing a ghost.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.559
Grand Tutor Xie.

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:03.679
You've finally come.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.000
You must save me.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.840
Please save me.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.399
Lord Su, will you stop

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:09.960
clinging to my legs when begging

00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:11.000
for help?

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.200
The court hasn't concluded

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:15.399
your case.

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:18.279
Don't get overly frightened.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:20.879
Heavens.

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:25.000
Now it's not just the court
that wants my life.

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:28.799
Even ghosts want me dead.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.120
What do you mean, Lord Su?

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:37.759
There are no supernatural forces.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.000
You should avoid such thoughts, Lord Su.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.279
Lord Xie.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.600
Don't go.

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:48.320
Here's the truth.

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:51.320
Guess who I saw last night?

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:53.519
I saw

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.960
the Grand Princess.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.279
What happened back then

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.559
had nothing to do with me.

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:12.080
Those higher-ups...

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.879
My words carry little weight.

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.000
There was nothing I could do.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.799
Lord Xie,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.399
could you bring me a few

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.960
protective amulets?

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.240
Or invite some eminent monks?

00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:32.279
You wish to exorcise the ghost?

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.320
No.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.480
So you want to

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.639
hold a memorial service
for the Grand Princess,

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:40.879
so she stops haunting you?

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:44.600
A memorial service?

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:46.279
Good idea.

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.200
But

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.240
where should we hold the ritual?

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:53.679
Lord Su,

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:55.879
we both serve the court.

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:57.399
Let me think.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:58.679
Alright.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:06.200
The Chaohuang Academy.

00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:09.240
The Grand Princess...

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:12.399
That's right.

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:13.840
The Chaohuang Academy

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.840
still holds her memorial tablet.

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:22.279
Su Wei acted swiftly.

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:25.799
The jailer hid it in leftover food
to smuggle out.

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.480
I detained him and got the note.

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:31.960
Care to guess who it's for?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.320
- Huo Wan.
- Huo Wan.

00:12:46.624 --> 00:12:49.632
(To Her Majesty: Xie Fei offers a plan
to clear my name. Can I trust him?)

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:53.120
You're truly wise, my mentor.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.240
I'm not too bad as your disciple, right?

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.799
(Both you and I serve the higher-ups.)

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:16.360
(If you could pull some strings)

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:19.320
(and get the higher-ups
to speak for you...)

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.519
Su Wei wrote to Her Majesty, Huo Wan,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.759
instead of her father, Chancellor Huo.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.399
Interesting.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.240
They're not so close as we thought.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.200
When they fight,

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.919
we profit.

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:42.519
I'll need your assistance.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.360
Anything for you.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.159
What does it mean?

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:54.480
You know what I mean.

00:13:56.159 --> 00:13:57.679
You're good-looking

00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:01.279
and you're Her Majesty's
childhood friend.

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:03.840
If you were willing
to whisper in her ear,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.080
we'd surely gain unexpected advantages.

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:15.080
What does it mean?

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:17.320
I will do

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.799
whatever you say.

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:24.480
You'll seduce someone?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.720
Alright.

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:27.559
Kill someone?

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:28.679
Alright.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.159
You'll do things

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.159
a gentleman wouldn't do?

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:33.720
No problem.
