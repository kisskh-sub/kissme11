[The Glory of Queen]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
[Episode 8]

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.980
In the fragrance identification round,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.540
Contestants Four and Six
got four scents wrong,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.660
Contestants Two and Three got two wrong,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.620
while Contestants One

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.860
and Five

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.860
got everything right,
making them the winners of this round.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.060
Those brought in at the last minute
really aren't up to the task.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.340
They can't even make it
into the top three.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.680
In the fragrance detection round,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.220
she tied for first place
with Contestant Three,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.100
and she also ranks first
in fragrance identification.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.860
In such a short time,
she has learned remarkably fast.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.780
Her talent

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.100
rivals that of Jingheng.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.460
Even though Second Young Master
was punished,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.300
he's still been concerned
about your health.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.260
I know Jingheng is dutiful,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.180
and his life hasn't been easy
over the years.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.420
Yet the one
who should have stepped up hasn't,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.940
and amid all this strife,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.780
it seems they've forgotten
that we are family.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.020
Madam Zhang,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.820
what do you think of that child?

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.540
When it comes to fragrance-making,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.740
she's actually quite good.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.860
She's willing to focus and learn.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.020
I've met her a few times,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.220
and she seems sensible
with her words and actions.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.980
This is the final round
of the Fragrance Competition,

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.180
and it's the most important one:
fragrance-making.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.180
Whoever comes out on top in this round

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.020
will be the winner
of this year's competition.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.020
Each of you has been provided with

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.180
identical fragrance-making tools,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.540
so think carefully
about the blend you wish to create.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.830
You have the time
it takes one incense stick to burn.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.300
Now, start.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.230
You want to use
the Fragrance Competition

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.740
to plant someone in the Pei family.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.820
You're utterly delusional.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.900
This time,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.380
I'll make sure
you never get back on your feet.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.060
The counterweight is wrong.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.540
Why has she stopped?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.020
Is there something wrong with the tool?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.780
Why has Song Zhiyao stopped?

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.580
Looks like there's something wrong
with the counterweight.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.500
If the counterweight is faulty,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.340
how can she weigh the fragrance powder?

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.460
Anyone can follow a recipe

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.660
if all the ingredients are prepared

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.780
in the right proportions for them.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.180
But the art of crafting a fragrance
lies in adaptability.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.620
Let's just wait and see.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.820
Only if she can overcome that

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.860
will she be the person
I'm truly looking for.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.060
Why has Contestant Five stopped?

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.660
She performed very well
during the fragrance identification

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.020
and detection rounds.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.700
Fragrance identification
and detection are just the basics.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.820
Having a good memory or learning quickly

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.940
can make someone stand out.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.860
But making a fragrance is different.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.300
She's only been learning
for a few months.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.820
She's likely just barely managing.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.780
The counterweight can't be used.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.900
Even a one-gram error
can alter the scent.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.620
What should I do?

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.100
Is this stumping you?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.980
Who do you think you're looking down on?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.820
Think a little harder.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.860
What was that for?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.140
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.180
There's nothing wrong with having
everything prepared in advance.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.300
But if a situation arises,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.500
like not having a steelyard,
or if it's broken,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.100
how would you make a fragrance then?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.020
I'd just use my hands.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.420
With your level of skill,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.620
you actually dare to weigh it by hand?

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.300
Besides,
something this light can't possibly

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.620
be measured accurately that way.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.180
Then what else can I use?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.380
Use whatever you have at hand.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.620
You need to know
the weight of what you're carrying.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.740
The steelyard and counterweight
follow a one-hundred-to-one ratio.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.380
In other words,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.900
your old counterweight could measure
objects up to ten liang at most.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.540
Once you understand this principle,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.860
even a branch can serve as a steelyard.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.020
So,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.700
I can use this as well?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.260
Absolutely.

I think Contestant One's fragrance
stands out the most.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.460
How about you all?

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.460
Yes,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.900
I also quite like
Contestant One's fragrance powder.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.580
I actually think
Contestant Five's fragrance powder

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.900
is exceptionally unique.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.780
It's named "Sober Intoxication."

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.020
The cleverest touch
is the addition of rice liquor,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.340
creating a feeling
of being on the verge of intoxication.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.740
To accomplish this
in just the time it takes

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.340
for one incense stick to burn

00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:14.355
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.420
is no small feat.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.980
What do you all think?

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.740
I think Contestant Five's fragrance
is the most unique.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.900
We also choose Contestant Five.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.980
The winner
of this year's Fragrance Competition

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.980
is Contestant Five,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.940
Song Zhiyao.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.140
I knew it would be her.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.420
I told you she could make it.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:46.820
Go

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.220
and bring her over.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.060
Yes.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.820
Thank you, My Lady.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.780
Don't assume that being the winner

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.820
makes you special.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.980
You got lucky this time,

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.500
but the Pei family values
real skill above all.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.540
You're right, My Lady.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.660
Starting today,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.860
I will not slack off.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.500
I'll devote myself
to studying fragrance-making.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.100
Miss Song,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.780
Madam would like to see you.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:28.540
Greetings, Madam.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.180
Take a seat.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.780
No need. I can just stand here.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.020
Who else is in your family?

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.900
I… I've been an orphan
since I was little.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.580
I was taken in by an old beggar,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.460
but he passed away a few years ago.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.340
Good girl.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.740
Who taught you how to read and write?

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.580
The old beggar who took me in

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.740
was once a scholar.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.580
He ended up in misfortune
after breaking his leg in an accident.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.300
He taught many kids
how to read and write.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.260
It's fate that Jingheng brought you

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.700
to the Pei Manor.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.420
Be honest with me,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.220
do you wish to learn more?

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.060
Staying at the Pei Manor

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.980
is the only way to get more clues
to find my aunt.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.980
Of course, I do.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.500
Then would you be willing
to marry into the Pei Manor?

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.740
I have two grandsons.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.180
You may marry whichever one you prefer.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.980
Marry...?
