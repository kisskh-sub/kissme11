[Episode 20]

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.720
Pass me a glass.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.039
Help yourself.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.500
Uncle, everything will be
smooth sailing from now on.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.110
Where we go and how far we go

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.170
is all dependent on you

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.530
and on Wan's now.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.800
Here, let me toast to you.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800
Thank you, Uncle.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.840
This is good liquor.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.520
Our champion is back.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.210
Come, have a drink with us.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.120
Come on, pour a drink for our champion!

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.320
Our champion is here.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.890
Mr. Wan,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.310
can we chat privately?

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.360
Go ahead.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.610
Come, let's keep drinking.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.790
It's about Jin Zhao.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.360
How did he fall?

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.570
His skills were lacking.

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.340
I could've beaten him.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.050
You've already won.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.829
I could've won on my own merit.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.930
The process doesn't matter.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.640
You are now Wan's Garage's

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.660
top driver.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.840
Congratulations.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.420
I don't deserve it.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.450
Now you do.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.890
How ungrateful.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.500
Come on, pour me a drink!

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.650
Pour Mr. Wan a drink!

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.260
Here we go! Bottom's up!

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.790
Fill up all your glasses!

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.120
Fill them up!

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.590
The call's connected!

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.010
If Brandy had his phone on him

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.570
and the car exploded,
but the phone still works...

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.670
Is it possible that

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.000
Brandy wasn't in the car when it exploded?

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.870
He wasn't in the car?

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.470
Then where could he be?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.010
No news from hospitals or police stations.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
Where could he be?

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.440
Jiang Mu.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.000
Boss, do you remember

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.120
that guy who always wore a baseball cap?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.330
I can't recall.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.880
He often chatted with you,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.320
and he is around my height.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.610
You mean Lu,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.650
who often buys from me?

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.240
Yes, do you have his contact info?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.020
Could I get his phone number?

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.900
Just a moment.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.090
0264530204.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.780
That's correct.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.450
Thank you, Boss.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.250
No problem.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.050
I got it!

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.120
Here.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.940
Hello, Officer Lu.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.680
This is Jiang Mu.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.550
Jin Zhao, is he...

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.350
Is he still alive?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.970
Give me a moment.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.810
Fu.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.420
Keep an eye on things.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.110
Jiang Mu, right?

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.630
Jin Zhao is still in critical condition.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.760
I'll let you know when I have good news.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.690
Okay.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.820
Can I at least visit him?

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.920

I can't tell you where he currently is.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.910

Why is it you?

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.160
Why are you here?

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.250
Where's my mom?

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.350
Yinghan didn't come.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.590
Mu.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.460
I have something to tell you.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.230
You may not be able to accept it just yet,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.320
but I think I must tell you.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.720
Around...

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.410
last October,

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.350
five and a half months after
I met your mother,

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.560
your mother was diagnosed with

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.890
aortic stenosis,

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.010
with a severity of 78 percent.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.840
The diagnosis is aortic stenosis,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.770
with a severity of 78 percent.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.700
You need surgery urgently.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:34.840
This...

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.940
Doctor, what exactly do you mean?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.840
Aortic stenosis

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.560
becomes very serious when it
exceeds 75 percent.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.010
If it progresses further,

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.340
the blood vessels could become
completely blocked.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.010
We need to perform
the coronary bypass surgery

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.220
to establish a new pathway.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.700
You can think it over,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.940
but please decide quickly.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.780
Thank you, Doctor.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.770
Chris.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.420
Let's break up.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.620
What?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.920
You know about my condition now.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.120
I don't want to become your burden.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.130
This is just an illness.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.530
Why should we break up?

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.270
The doctor said I need surgery,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.720
and this surgery

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.500
isn't 100 percent guaranteed to succeed.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.900
Even if it's successful,

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.930
full recovery isn't guaranteed either.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.210
I don't want to be a burden to you.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.330
So what?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.010
We are 100 percent in love.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.490
That's all that matters.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.980
Why do you have to be
so brutal to yourself?

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.170
We're lovers?

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.180
Yes.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.680
Darling,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.120
let's get married.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.790
Marry me.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.300
Are you proposing to me now?

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.790
I have a good friend

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.200
in Canada

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.960
who's a cardiovascular specialist.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.890
When we get back,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.780
I'll email him right away.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.900
If possible,

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.240
we'll go to Canada for the surgery.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320
I'll do as you say.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.290
Also, we should tell Mumu.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.330
No.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.800
We can't tell Mumu.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.160
But I think having Mumu by your side

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.090
would help you recover faster.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.050
No.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.570
We absolutely cannot tell Mumu.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.130
She's still a child.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.360
I don't want to burden her

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.960
or make her worry.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.570
So you must promise me

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.430
to keep this from Mumu.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:15.960
Otherwise,

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.410
I won't get treatment.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.060
You...

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.120
Alright.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.720
I'll do as you wish.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.090
Just recently,

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.650
your mom's surgery went smoothly.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.210
I just hope you can accompany her to her

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.390
follow-up appointments.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.750
Since your mom got sick,

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.150
she keeps looking at your photos.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.810
I know she really misses you.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.680
Mu.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.800
Your mom really needs you now.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.890
I'm sorry,

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.410
Chris,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.100
for my attitude towards you previously.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.280
Thank you for staying with
my mom all this time.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.410
Mu,

The Crab Nebula you see now

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.300

that exploded in 1054 AD.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.580
Its central pulsar has

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.850
a rotation period of 33 milliseconds,

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.960

Her condition is gradually improving.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.860
I often tell her

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.930
about our time together in Manshi.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.300
Sometimes,

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.280
she even takes the initiative
to ask me about you.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.100
But I don't know the exact situation
on your end either,

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.340
so I can only tell Mom

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.790
that you're doing fine.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.890
But...

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.930
are you really okay?

I'm Julia.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.090

He specifically invited me back
from Canada.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:14.710
The upcoming rehabilitation
will be very tough,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.630
but believe me,

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.630
it will definitely help you.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.880
Hold it there.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.100

Yes.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.260
Push harder. Control it.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:44.480
Great!

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.170
In the early stages, we'll work through

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.900
hip and knee flexion exercises

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.610
to train your joint mobility and strength.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.350
Now, try it yourself.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.650
I've gradually adapted to life here

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:23.090
and made new friends.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.220
Also,

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.730
all those difficult technical terms

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.580
our professors use in class,

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.400
I can understand them all now.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:30.650
Zhao,

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.520
how are things over there?

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.440
In terms of surgery,

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.240
we've done all we can.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.090
The rest depends mainly on rehabilitation.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:40.090
I understand.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.280
Doctor,

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.410
will he be able to race again?

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:47.520
Racing?

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.190
Being able to stand

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.440
and live without a wheelchair
would be fortunate enough.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.640
Forget about racing.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:53.890
Sir,

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.120
your spinal nerves have been injured

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.340
and you have multiple tendon tears.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.440
The rehabilitation process

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.700
will be extremely long and painful.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.430
You must be mentally prepared.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.040
Thank you.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.240
Let me see you out.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.510
Contact me if you need anything.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.810
Jiang Mu sent you a message?

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.760
She's been messaging you a lot
these past three months, hasn't she?

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.390
You didn't leave all of them unanswered,
did you?

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.840
In my current condition,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.530
how am I supposed to respond to her?

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.890
Should I tell her,

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.130
"Mu,

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.470
I'll most likely be disabled
in the future,

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.510
either using crutches

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.340
or in a wheelchair.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.140
Would you still want to be with me?"

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.480
Jiang Mu would be willing.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.480
But I'm not.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.200
She deserves a better life.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.330
Besides, the case isn't closed yet.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.740
Sanlai,

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.400
don't contact her either.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.910
We...

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.460
We should all try

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.610
to give her a peaceful life.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.440
I'm right here.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.080
You don't need
to be yearning day and night.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.630
I want to clear my name.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.210
Especially after you came.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:24.080
I want this proof of innocence even more.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:29.410
♪ Perhaps the weather's damp and mild ♪

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.890
I want to prove myself.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:29.590
At the very least,

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:33.260
♪ Perhaps it's about the habit
of bearing ♪

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.670
I deserve you.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.260

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:43.350

people have come and gone.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:50.010
♪ To be happy or heartbroken,
as transparent as I can be ♪

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.850
I've never been serious about anyone.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.340
So once I get serious,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.910
♪ Crossing the line for love,
I've walked 10,000 kilometers ♪

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.200

a chance to change your mind.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:04.410
♪ Brave enough to be sure is my instinct ♪

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.600

Zhao.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.490
Why won't you reply to my messages?

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.230
Even if you simply reply,

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:25.760
♪ Crossing the line for love,
I've walked 10,000 kilometers ♪

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:21.760
"I got it."

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.710
Even just an emoji would be fine.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.570
Why won't you respond to me?

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:33.250

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.390

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.670
Are you feeling better?

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.230
This sort of pain will come again.

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:17.150
Some of it is physical.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.680
Some of it are triggered by
traumatic memories.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.040
But mostly,

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.440
it's psychological and
physical pain intertwined.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:24.170
So,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.850
don't worry.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.000
I'll help you.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.960
Just relax.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.240
I'll go get busy now.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.840
Call me if you need anything.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:40.720
Lift your feet up. Don't drag them.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.580
Each step can be smaller,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.220
but keep them steady.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:51.730
Relax your upper body.

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.260
Try to use the strength
from your lower limbs.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.310
Good. Go slower.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.150
Yes.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:07.280
Lift your foot.

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:15.340
Very good.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:20.820
Good.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.810
Talented people

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.860
tend to bounce back pretty quickly.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.190
Let's stop here for today.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.120
Thank you.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.370
Have some water.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.409
I have good news for you.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.480
The case has been solved.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.250
Really?

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.940
The amount involved is enormous.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.770
Approaching 800 million yuan.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.410
It was largely thanks to He Zhang
turning himself in

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:07.770
and becoming a prosecution witness

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.970
that the case had a major breakthrough.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:19.970
What brings you here?

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.410
I'm sorry.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.300
Why are you apologizing to me?

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.960
Because...

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.980
I don't want to lose to you.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.800
When I was at Wan's,

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:52.070
I did many things that wronged you.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.800
But about Wan Shengbang
tampering with your car,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.890
I truly didn't know.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:04.660
Jin Zhao,

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.310
if there's still a chance,

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.010
I wish to challenge you fairly once more.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.510
I'm going to turn myself in.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:37.430
He Zhang provided information

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.490
on the trading methods between
Wan's and the Alliance.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:47.370
The Navy Headquarters and
the Anti-Smuggling Bureau joined forces,

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.810
and with police departments
cooperating nationwide,

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.810
we've arrested everyone involved.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.730
Wan Dayong was caught immediately.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:56.570
As for Wan Shengbang,

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.890
he was caught while fleeing to Vietnam.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.770
As for your accident,

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.330
Wan Shengbang coerced your mechanic

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.000
by threatening his family's safety,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.880
forcing him to tamper with your car's

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.810
braking system,

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:09.740
which caused the accident.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.660
The mechanic has been arrested

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.800
and awaits further processing.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:16.480
In short,

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.000
no one got away.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.650
That puts my mind at ease.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.160
During the first interrogation,

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.090
Wan Dayong confessed everything,

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:30.600
including your case from years ago.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.540
The guy honestly admitted

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.640
that he swapped out parts

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.370
using inferior replacements.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.160
You had nothing to do with it.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.730
Thank you.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.420
My wish has been fulfilled.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.410
Jin Zhao,

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.780
we should be thanking you.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.610
You've been through a lot these years.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.120
Alright, I have work to do.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.650
Take good care of yourself.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:40.370
I saw the news.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.610
Is it all over now?

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.600
During this time...

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.230
you must have been so worried.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.500
Is the mission over?

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.260
Almost.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.830
Did you see the Luminous Pearl

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:13.950
from that night?

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:20.750
Yes, I did.

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:23.100
So...

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.710
when the explosion happened,

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:25.590
you weren't there.
