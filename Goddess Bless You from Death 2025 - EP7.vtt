00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.360
Who did you ask to keep
the Tukkata Sia-Kaban?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.055
Darin said there might be
another seven-body sacrifice.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.640
I've eaten seven.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.280
And I'll eat seven more.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.176
Thup came back.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.177
Thup - Came back.

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.000
Makes me think of
what happened to Maysa, my sister.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.600
If you're ever ready
to talk, you can tell me.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.896
I'd rather start over with you again.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.576
Mr. Thamawat Santasakon.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.656
You're under arrest for joint murder.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.000
So this is what you want?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.600
Move.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.776
Sorry, Inspector.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.880
Inspector King ordered that

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.736
no unrelated personnel
may visit the suspect.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.160
Especially…

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.120
Inspector Singha.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.936
Why can't I get in?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.360
I've been on this case from the start.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.120
Please don't make this
hard for me, Inspector.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.880
I don't want to get punished.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.456
You want him yelling at you later,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840
or me yelling at you now, huh?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.320
Oops.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.360
Uh… I was just taking a break.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.336
I'll go to the restroom for ten minutes.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.840
As for this part

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.880
I'll leave it to you, Inspector.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.720
Are you okay?

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.200
I'm fine.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.759
Does it hurt?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.880
It's nothing.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.320
How did you even get in here?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.960
I heard Inspector King banned all visits.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.120
I've got my ways.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.039
Did he force you? Or hurt you?

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.735
You don't have to worry.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.479
No one would dare do anything
that out in the open.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.040
A case like this has
too many eyes watching.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.280
You don't know King
and his guys well enough.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.400
They're the last people you can trust.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.600
Hang in there.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.840
I'm working on getting you out.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.920
I'm really okay… you know.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.480
Just believe in me.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.320
Believe I didn't do it,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.079
What are you talking about?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.360
If I didn't believe in you…

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.600
Why would I be doing all this?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.160
I'll get you out of here. No matter what.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.840
Didn't I make myself clear?

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.640
No one goes in.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.496
Don't blame Goh for this.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.880
I came in on my own.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.680
And if you've got something to say,
say it to my face.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.200
Don't take it out on others.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.440
Why the hell would
I have a problem with my team?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.600
But from now on,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.840
I'll assign guards here around the clock.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.280
No one gets in. I don't care who they are.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.560
Follow proper protocol, Inspector.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.280
This is a major case.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.256
People are watching.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.800
Someone like me,

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.400
I always do what's right.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.600
Save that for telling yourself.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.560
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.560
P'Sing, are you okay?

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.800
If I'm not, what can I do?

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.256
What do we do with the team now?

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.400
Our spiritual advisor suddenly
became the prime suspect.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.680
You really think Thup did it?

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.159
I don't think that at all.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.880
If he were the killer,
he would've fled long ago.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.080
Why would he stay
and help us investigate?

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.720
Then we need to find the real killer.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.640
What about Ta Khuean? How is he?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.776
I checked his financial records.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.880
The money he used to buy
the house and the car,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.176
all of it,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.520
came from donations from Santi Tham House.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.856
So the most we can charge him
with is embezzlement.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.480
Not murder.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.160
And if Ta Khuean really is the killer,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.080
what would be his motive?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.336
I'd like to report a missing person.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.976
- You can't go in, ma'am.
- Please calm down.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.160
You can't go in.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.816
You need to file the report
at your local station first.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.016
- Please calm down.
- Entry is not allowed.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.056
- What's going on?
- She can't enter, sir.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.776
My grandson is missing.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.816
It's been two days. I can't reach him.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.976
I told her to report it at the
local station, but she won't listen.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.176
I did.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.760
- But nothing has moved forward.
- How about this,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.856
Write down your grandson's name.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.296
I'll coordinate with the
local police right away.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.080
If there's any progress, I'll contact you.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.159
All right.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.760
His name is Natee Rungbariwan.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.936
Don't worry.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.520
I'll follow up right away.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.159
Yes, yes. Thank you so much.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.776
- Thank you.
- This way, ma'am.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.896
- Yes, yes.
- This way.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.000
Take care of it.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.880
- Mek.
- Yes?

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.320
Thup.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.440
P'Sing asked me to look after you.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.000
Here.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.880
This is all I can do.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.040
Thank you so much.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.240
Mm.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.080
I've never asked you for anything.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.680
But if you really are sacred,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.000
please protect Thup.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.280
He's a good person.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.280
And he didn't do anything wrong.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.680
It's happening again.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.776
It's happening.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.456
It's happening.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.080
It's happening.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.600
You? Renting a Thao Wessuwan statue?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.280
I can't believe it.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.880
I just wanted you to feel at ease.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.280
Or you don't want it?

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.920
I can return it right now.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.160
I want it.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.200
I asked around.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.320
They said Thao Wessuwan,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.576
he's the one who wards off evil.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.240
Spirits. Ghosts.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.360
So you won't have to be scared.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.560
Sey.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.800
Where are you going?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.160
Sey.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.056
I've eaten seven.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.160
And I'll eat seven more.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.056
Hey,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.520
Hey, wake up.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.120
Hey.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.600
You okay?

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.280
Sey… is that really you?

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.056
Yeah.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.240
It's me.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.640
What's wrong?

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.200
Nightmare?

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.480
I don't think it was just a nightmare.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.760
It was a warning.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.240
Huh?

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.400
I

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.800
I dreamed that,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.760
I was taken for a ritual.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.960
I was hung on a tree,
just like the body we opened.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.840
Calm down.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.760
It was just a dream.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.136
Don't overthink it.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.760
But it felt so real, man.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.176
That ghost's voice I heard,

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.080
it's still echoing in my head.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.240
If I really am the killer's next target,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.080
what the hell am I supposed to do, Sey?

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.240
You need to stay focused.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.240
You've got me here.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.120
I won't let anyone hurt you.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.040
Don't be scared.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.680
- Uh… hello.
- Hello.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.456
Sorry to interrupt. I'm Niti.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.960
These are for…

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.600
Your room. All of it.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.176
Buying this much,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.680
you trying to bury my room with it?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.456
Guess I'm stressed.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.880
Ended up clicking too much.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.560
It's fine.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.200
Something wrong?

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.400
Pass me the cutter.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.416
Why?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.720
Wrong item?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.056
Maybe I ordered too much.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.440
So they threw in extras.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.440
With this much stuff,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.440
they should've added ten more things.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.200
You're early today.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.120
You think you can visit the suspect?

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.960
Stay out of my business.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.520
Go work for the taxpayers.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.800
You assigned guards to
watch that kid last night.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.880
Why? You care about him that much?

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.376
Just because I don't say it,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.896
doesn't mean I don't know.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.600
All of this… is your doing.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.680
You ordered someone to
plant drugs on Thup, didn't you?

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.800
Inspector.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.800
Do you have any proof?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.776
I've been to his room.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.616
There wasn't a single pill you mentioned.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.240
Anyone can see it's your handiwork.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.856
Your father told you to do it, didn't he?

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.280
Whatever I do is my business.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.000
But this case will close under my name.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.096
Unless you beg,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.480
or crawl back to me.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.480
Then maybe I'll think
about letting that kid go.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.240
I'm not selling myself out
over something this small.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.816
I'll catch the real killer. No matter what.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.840
And you,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.240
stay out of my way.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.720
I'm sorry.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.600
Why are you sorry?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.600
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.160
If I'd just swallowed my pride
with King a bit more,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.920
you'd be out by now.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.800
If you have to bow to Inspector King,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.976
I'd rather stay in jail.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.600
Don't joke like that.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.080
If I don't get you out,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.720
you're definitely doing long time.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.400
So what,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.960
you're really giving in to Inspector King?

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.696
So I can start preparing myself?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.720
For years behind bars,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.696
or maybe even execution.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.319
For killing seven people.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.040
You really dare say that?

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.480
Pretty bold, aren't you.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.800
I'm not being bold.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.896
I just know,

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.400
you'd never leave me like this.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.200
Am I right?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.080
I may talk big,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.360
but you need to catch the killer fast.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.560
I want to sleep in my own bed again.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.960
I know. Don't tell me.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.880
Yeah? What is it?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.160
P'Sing.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.280
Can you bring the team to the scene?

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.056
I found a crucial piece of evidence.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.040
It might clear Thup from the case.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.720
Yeah, we're coming.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.360
Local police reported
a murder discovered at dawn.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.400
The victim is Natee Rungbariwan.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.280
His name is Natee Rungbariwan.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.656
The missing nephew.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.840
P'Sing.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.176
There's something in the details,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.480
that might connect to our case.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.400
What details, Sey?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.760
Better if you see it yourself.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.176
The killer did everything to the victim,

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.560
exactly like the Seven-Tree murders.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.280
But the killer didn't finish.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.160
Why?

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.840
They probably lured him here last night.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.480
He must've struggled during the stitching.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.120
Then ran off this way.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.720
Judging by the marks on the neck,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.880
he was strangled until he couldn't breathe.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.896
Inspector.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.080
Here's the clip recorded at the scene.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.520
Hey! What are you doing, stop!

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.880
Send it to the analysis teams now.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.120
Yes, sir.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.200
I'll send people to pull more
CCTV around the area.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.400
Think it's a copycat?

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.976
The details,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.560
the way it was done,

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.440
match the construction-site murder.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960
Looks like the real killer.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.520
But he rushed it,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.600
and someone probably saw him.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.680
Didn't you say this only
happens every five years?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.600
It hasn't even been that long. Why again?

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.880
I don't know.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.520
But one thing's clear,

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.520
a murder done like this

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.680
means the main suspect you arrested

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.240
isn't the real killer.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.320
So you should release Thup already.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.456
Bet you're thrilled.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.400
Thrilled my ass, someone died.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.280
Focus on catching the real one, man.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.160
So no one else ends up dead.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.080
Here you go, dear.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.920
Want some water?

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.280
Auntie.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.560
Oh?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.040
You're the one who
came asking the other day.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.656
You're a police officer?

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.560
Where's Ta Khuean, Auntie?

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.216
Oh, Ta Khuean,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.176
he hasn't been here for days.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.200
Doesn't pick up my calls either.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.160
Auntie.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.920
Have you seen this man?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.720
Has he ever come here?

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.720
I don't recognize him.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.120
Definitely not one of Master Soon's pupils.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.360
Please take a good look.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.856
Here.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.560
I really don't know him.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.456
If he came here often,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.320
I'd remember his face.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.880
Here.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.200
Take it back, dear.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.296
What?

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.520
Didn't you say we needed to check here?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.456
If it's the same case,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.920
everyone who died should link back here.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.000
But it turns out like this.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.560
Makes him harder to track.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.400
Ko, send people to pull
CCTV around here for me.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.080
Every road connected to Santi Tham House.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.480
I'll have someone check Ta Khuean's place.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.280
I want to know where
he was when it happened.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.640
Mom, who are the police arresting?

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.000
We're not arresting anyone.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.840
Just asking for information.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.480
Have you ever seen this man?

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.200
That's… the ice delivery guy.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.656
But someone else has
been delivering for a week.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.976
Which shop? Do you have their number?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.296
Oh, Natee, right?

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.736
Yeah, he delivered our supplies.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.576
He drops stuff here a lot,
and drinks there often.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.456
Natee delivers ice.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.240
Mostly works with Ta Khuean.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.176
Gets drunk and brags about
making money with Ta Khuean.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.760
By living off traders at Santi Tham House.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.376
Contact Ta Khuean's relatives yet?

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.680
He has none.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.456
His wife and kid are dead.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.160
Nothing to do with Ta Khuean.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.280
Mek.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.680
When was Natee born?

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.880
Sunday.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.040
Why?

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.456
But the spirit told me

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.920
it ate seven.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.840
And will eat seven more.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.800
Wednesday.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.800
Wednesday.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.120
Wednesday.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.680
My birthday.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.840
Darin was born Wednesday.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.160
And today's Sunday.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.800
I'm telling you.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.320
It's starting again.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.480
You think the killer's
completing all seven days?

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.560
I don't think so.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.000
But it's possible.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.600
If the killer's the same person.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.320
They're finding seven new sacrifices.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.776
(Special Investigation Unit)

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.256
Tell me.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.600
How something this insane happened.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.720
Simple, Commander.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.400
Means the man Inspector King arrested

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.360
wasn't the real culprit.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.040
And the evidence
Inspector King used on Thup,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.960
like the GHB,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.760
likely wasn't his.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.160
Inspector.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.440
So…

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.936
Thup's staying at P'Singha's house now.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.840
I can get into his old rental room.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.880
Handle it for me.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.280
I just followed orders
to close the case fast.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.336
Thamawat was the most suspicious.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.080
- But he wasn't.
- Stop.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.040
Your father sent you.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.640
I respect him.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.880
But you can't do this.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.880
I think it's best

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.400
you adjust your approach a little.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.040
Understood.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.800
Did I say you could sit?

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.520
This is my house.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.880
Not yours.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.320
So why'd you call me here?

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.720
Just to yell at me?

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.096
Why? Such a small case,

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.256
and it still won't close.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.096
Even with a suspect already.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.400
Just wrap it up.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.480
If it's that easy,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.560
do it yourself.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.416
Why send me?

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.096
I sent you

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.656
so you'd earn credit.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.936
Not embarrass me like this.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.280
I followed you and planted
the drugs on Thamawat.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.080
But he isn't the culprit.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.576
We should focus on the real one.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.520
Who asked for your opinion?

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.720
Oh, right.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.160
You think you're big now, huh?

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.360
In this field,

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.960
no one knows better than me.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.200
Over something this small?

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.600
Others do far worse.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.160
I've crossed lines for you so many times.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.320
But I don't want to be
looked down on anymore.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.256
I want to be a real cop.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.480
Not someone's puppet.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.320
Just a moment working close

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.320
to that stray mutt,

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.640
and you're acting like him now.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.440
Who do you mean?

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.000
Who else.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.440
That Inspector Singha.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.280
He got you thinking you're
suddenly stronger, huh?

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.560
Want me to show you how
I cut a chicken for a monkey again?

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.400
This time I'll get him
removed from service.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:58.000
Wanna try?

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.296
Hey.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.480
What's wrong?

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.880
Back's a bit sore.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.040
Didn't sleep well there.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.480
Here, take your shirt off.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.320
Shirt off.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.680
Are you about to do something to me?

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.296
Do what?

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.760
I'm putting balm on.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.600
Or you want pain like this?

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.640
Fine.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.376
Come on, I'll help.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.576
Will this ever finish?

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.800
Come.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.280
What?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.280
Turn around.

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.320
Come here.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.800
Thanks.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.400
And…

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.560
When you weren't there when I got released,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.000
you were doing this?

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.600
Why.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.880
Didn't like it?

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.040
I did.

00:30:44.041 --> 00:30:52.375
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.760
But…

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.680
Means I don't get to
sleep upstairs anymore?

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.080
It's not that you can't sleep upstairs.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.400
I'm moving down here.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.680
To watch you.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.920
Why.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.760
The tent fits many.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.360
Heh, I already fill it alone.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.800
Come.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.400
I'll show you.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.800
Well?

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.080
Full enough?

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.400
If you want to trick me
into the tent, just say so.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.000
I'm not tricking you.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.800
But if I told you straight,

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.720
would you come in?

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.680
I'll do anything P'Sing tells me to.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.360
I'm a good boy.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.040
P', what are you doing?

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:54.440
Sorry, the number you
have dialed is unavailable.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.576
(Singha)

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.680
(Calling Singha)

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.200
Sorry, the number you
have dialed is unavailable.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.360
Uh, P'Singha.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.760
I've been meaning to ask you.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.400
Why do you live here alone?

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.240
Where is everyone else?

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.680
Everyone else,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.240
meaning who?

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.400
Well…

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.040
In your house,

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.760
there are photos of your mom and sister.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.360
No one lives here.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.880
My sister's gone.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.760
And my mom,

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.560
she chose to live somewhere else.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.159
I couldn't keep them here.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.800
I'm sorry, P'Singha.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.880
If I made you uncomfortable.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:25.880
No.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.320
My sister,

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.199
she had something like you.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:42.320
She could see spirits like me?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.120
Yeah.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.159
Back then I didn't believe her.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.320
She asked me to help.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.000
But I didn't.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.680
Because I didn't believe her.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.560
I let my sister…

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.080
Die just like that.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.200
But it's been a long time.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.600
Now I…

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.200
Can live alone.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.560
The past is the past.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.080
Yes, P'Singha.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.200
The past is the past.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.840
I don't know what you faced.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.040
But you'll never let me die too.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.920
And I,

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.120
will never leave you.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.680
You're up early today.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.600
And you, why are you up?

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.096
I was going to give alms.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.680
And buy breakfast for you.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.520
Want to go together?

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.560
Okay.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.976
I'll shower first.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.640
And don't forget to use this too.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.880
A rough cop like me needs this?

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.376
Of course.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.680
Cops should take care of themselves too.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.296
When you go meet people,

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.496
and they see your handsome face,

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.256
they'll cooperate more.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.640
Handsome face.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.720
Okay.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.000
I'll try it.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.280
And…

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.760
You waking up early like this,

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.400
something wrong?

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.760
I dreamed of Maysa.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.040
Maybe because you
talked about her yesterday.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.376
Or…

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.080
Maybe she misses you.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.080
If you're uneasy,

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.800
want to make merit for her?

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.000
I'll take you then.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.520
Have you ever done it?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.160
Never.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.560
I don't know if merit even reaches her.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.240
So I never did it.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.560
No one can know.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.120
But at least,

00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.800
the one doing it feels better.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.560
Okay.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.296
I'll do it.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.560
Then

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.880
let's go to the temple I gave alms at.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.240
I have a place in mind.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.880
It's really peaceful here.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.720
Feels like a meditation place for sure.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.680
How'd you know this place?

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.440
This is my mom.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.200
Hello.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.640
Hello, dear.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.760
Coming all the way here today,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.080
is something wrong?

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.960
I met someone who sees like Maysa, Mom.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.760
Thank you, Thup,

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.600
for bringing my son.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.040
Came to make merit.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.696
Since getting here,

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.520
haven't seen Singha's face at all.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.720
I didn't bring P'Singha here.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.280
Last night P'Singha dreamed of Maysa,

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.320
so wanted to come feel at ease.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.520
But without Thup,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Singha wouldn't believe any of this.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.000
I really want Singha to let go,

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.256
that he wasn't at fault
for his brother's death.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.000
But it's hard.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.840
Hope I'm not crossing a line.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.600
You staying here,

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.400
it isn't because you're
mad at P'Singha, right.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.160
Singha probably thinks so.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.680
But I'm here

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.600
because I have to be.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.880
Thup, can you promise me,

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.880
that you'll stay and look after P'Singha.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.560
Why say something like that.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.400
Soon,

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.960
there may be something dangerous
coming for Singha.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.736
Even if I still don't know what it is,

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.776
I'm certain

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.480
that what's coming...

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.920
There must be a reason for it.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.880
Your gift, Thup,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.200
it could help Singha.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.480
Yes, Mae.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.080
I'll look after P'Singha myself.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.400
Please don't worry.

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.160
Thank you, dear.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.000
I'll head back now, Mae.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.120
May the holy spirits

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.096
shield and protect my child,

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.496
keeping all harm away.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.920
Bringing only peace and growth.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.856
Wherever you go,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.280
may you be safe, my child.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.280
Yes, thank you.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.776
Take care of yourself, dear.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.880
Yes.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.200
Thup, sure you're not heading home first.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.000
I'm not.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.800
I promised your Mae I'd look after you.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.440
Why would you look after me.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.560
Forgot I'm a cop.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.440
And you're clear of this case now, Thup.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.000
No need to stick to me anymore.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.520
No one can touch you now.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.360
I know.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.240
I chose to stay with you.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.160
Okay.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.400
Come on.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.080
Hello.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.480
Today,

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.000
they've been chanting
since morning, officer.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.680
Nothing the house staff know
that we won't know.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.280
Didn't you come asking
questions the other day.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.240
I'm looking for Ta Khuean right now.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.120
Mm, Ta Khuean.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.400
Heard he wasn't feeling well,

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:00.520
so took leave.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.536
If the center can tell me

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.640
anything about Ta Khuean, please do.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.760
Sure.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.720
Khuean was at Santi Tham House before me.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.480
But five years ago,

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.560
the former abbot passed away,

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.200
so Khuean

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.160
invited me to take over here.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.240
I saw people here

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.640
all needed spiritual support,

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.120
so I agreed.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.680
Meaning Ta Khuean is someone who

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.120
handles everything here, right.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.000
You could say that.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.480
I look after the villagers' well-being,

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.000
and Khuean handles donations,

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:44.560
using them to run the center.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:47.960
Is there a problem, officer.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.656
Right now Ta Khuean

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.440
is a suspect in a major case.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.120
What kind of case.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.216
I still don't have enough evidence

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.960
to get a warrant.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.840
But a lot of things point back to him.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.080
As for motive,

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.400
likely donation money.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.520
From what we've known of him,

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.880
he's always been kind-hearted.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.520
But money, desire,

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.920
greed,

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.240
can take over anyone.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.240
It's human nature.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.760
May I check Ta Khuean's office.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.840
Of course.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.880
Nothing's hidden here.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.656
This,

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.776
did he use donation money for gambling.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.440
He ran dirty money through
the center to wash it.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.600
Khun Meen.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.080
The victim who was killed,

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.280
was a debtor at Ta Khuean's den.

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.080
But it's strange.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.520
Killing someone over a debt?

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.240
You don't know gamblers at all.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.480
These people owe millions.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.800
I've seen many end like this.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.920
I think Ta Khuean

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.576
used these rituals

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.920
to cover his tracks,

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.280
so no one could trace back to him.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.856
But I still believe
whoever performed this rite

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.440
was after some kind of power for real.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.760
Hello.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.520
Oh, Uncle Chai?

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.000
Of course I remember.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.760
Okay, Uncle Chai. Thank you.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.080
What happened.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.160
Remember what you asked me?

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.360
Why they needed seven sacrifices

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.400
even though it's not five years yet.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.520
I remember. Why.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.336
Just now Uncle Chai,
my uncle in Sisaket,

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.480
He called saying this ritual,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.256
is a dark craft

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.680
that needs seven sacrifices.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.720
Because the performer draws
life-force into themselves.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.880
Some believe it extends lifespan,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.336
others think

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.240
it strengthens their fortune.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.136
But if the rite's incomplete,

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.720
or disrupted,

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.200
a new sacrifice is required.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.200
If not, the curse turns on them.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.176
So this,

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.576
is what they mean

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.600
when something dies under a curse,

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.680
it's tossed aside, uncared for.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.960
Want to rewind and break up again?

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.360
Why.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.640
Changing your mind?

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.080
Can I even change.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.120
So that means,

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.320
the body we found

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.280
was disrupted?

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.720
Meaning,

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.800
someone born on Sunday.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.400
Sey.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.280
Must be killed again.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.280
I need your help.

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:51.400
I'm looking for a man.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.896
P'Singha.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.536
But Darin and the kid named Jump
aren't connected at all.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.920
So why were they chosen.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.480
I need to know what he picks victims by.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.376
Should we go to where it began.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.936
- Where it began.
- The earliest case we know of.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.640
It happened in Sisaket, right.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.856
You're getting attached
to that kid more each day.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.120
Meaning I have no right to go back now?

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.976
Being with you,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.256
and not seeing ghosts,

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.280
I don't need anything else.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.680
(It's rising, rising.)

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.760
(Help me.)

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.016
Struggle.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.296
- Okay, cut.
- Cut, cut.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.160
- Want to get down first?
- I'm good.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.096
(So realistic.)

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.496
Really scary.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.600
But less scary since we can't see it.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.000
Watch how he puts it on, he's a pro.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.096
He wears it like this.
(You wanna hold hands?)

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.480
Top can't put it on.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.977
(The doctor's wicked.)

00:50:39.001 --> 00:50:40.040
Sorry.

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.360
Why say sorry.
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.400
(A little kiss for courage.)
