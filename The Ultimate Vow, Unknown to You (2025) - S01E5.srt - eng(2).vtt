I will uncover the truth
and avenge you with my own hands.

00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:15.127
Kill!

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.528
Find the right moment,

00:01:39.568 --> 00:01:40.487
then leave first.

00:01:49.787 --> 00:01:50.609
Careful.

00:01:52.275 --> 00:01:53.404
Yuwen Que.

00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:00.888
Let her go.

00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:03.249
General, you carry quite the air.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.006
Do you want the military seal,
or your life?

00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:06.760
General, you would do well
to think carefully.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.232
You...

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:08.474
General, you must not.

00:02:09.647 --> 00:02:11.407
If you dare harm her in the slightest,

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:13.528
I will make sure
you suffer a fate worse than death.

00:02:13.568 --> 00:02:15.207
That depends on the General's choice.

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:16.727
I will give you three days.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.327
(Joy)

00:02:37.328 --> 00:02:39.928
So it was Your Highness
who laid this perfect trap.

00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:44.488
You should have known long ago,

00:02:46.127 --> 00:02:47.768
I would never allow you to marry him.

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:49.887
A prince of Mobei,

00:02:50.527 --> 00:02:52.608
reduced to the ways of bandits,

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:55.328
seizing another man's wife by force.

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:57.928
Your Highness shows
such disregard for decorum.

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:00.528
The face of the Mobei royal family

00:03:00.768 --> 00:03:03.847
has been utterly ruined by you.

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:08.167
Do you think

00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:11.567
I care about any of that?

00:03:12.407 --> 00:03:13.447
You are insane.

00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:14.928
Yes.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:16.928
I am insane.

00:03:17.768 --> 00:03:19.447
Watching you marry another,

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:22.048
how could I not go mad?

00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:24.328
You lost the right
to say such things long ago.

00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:26.887
The moment you raised your blade
and struck,

00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:29.208
you should have known
this day would come.

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:41.208
Hate me if you wish.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.998
Kill me if you must.

00:03:43.168 --> 00:03:44.328
I accept it.

00:03:45.168 --> 00:03:46.395
But this time,

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.048
I will never let you escape.

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:57.328
Do you know how disgusting

00:03:57.407 --> 00:03:58.586
you look right now?

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:03.407
♪In the end, it becomes an epitaph♪

00:04:06.048 --> 00:04:08.127
You and I crossed that line long ago.

00:04:09.087 --> 00:04:11.248
We should have stood together
before the altar.

00:04:13.112 --> 00:04:14.967
It was Su Changji

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.215
who tore you away from me!

00:04:19.087 --> 00:04:22.368
Whatever bound us ended long ago.

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:30.007
Let go of me.

00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:35.007
Do you really think

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:37.368
this bit of pain
will make me release you?

00:04:50.968 --> 00:04:52.007
Go on, bite.

00:04:52.447 --> 00:04:54.408
That is the Ru I remember.

00:04:56.168 --> 00:04:56.968
Your Highness.

00:04:57.448 --> 00:04:59.288
His Majesty summons you
to the Imperial Study.

00:05:06.247 --> 00:05:07.527
Wait for me.

00:05:08.247 --> 00:05:09.887
We will finish this when I return.

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:18.168
Yuwen Que.

00:05:18.437 --> 00:05:19.994
You will die without mercy.

00:05:23.637 --> 00:05:25.327
Then we go to hell together.

00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:30.848
Watch her carefully.

00:05:31.437 --> 00:05:32.447
Do not let her

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:33.808
hurt herself.

00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:34.920
Yes.

00:05:38.687 --> 00:05:39.887
I swear,

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:42.446
you will pay

00:05:42.447 --> 00:05:44.127
for everything you did today.

00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:45.566
Your Majesty.

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:47.727
This is a treasured relic
from Mobei Changlong.

00:05:47.728 --> 00:05:49.800
It is said that whoever possesses
this tortoise shell

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.800
will be blessed
with great fortune over the realm.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.570
Very well.

00:05:53.968 --> 00:05:56.366
It is indeed a rare piece.

00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:59.127
Wen Ling, you have put
real thought into this.

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:04.408
Your Majesty, I pay my respects.

00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:07.447
Your behavior last night
in my Imperial Garden was reckless.

00:06:07.687 --> 00:06:09.345
Do not think it escaped me.

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:10.687
I accept my fault.

00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:11.808
Que.

00:06:11.812 --> 00:06:13.126
Wen Ling

00:06:13.127 --> 00:06:15.246
gentle in nature, and proper in conduct.

00:06:15.247 --> 00:06:17.527
I have already granted your marriage.

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:18.488
Father.

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:19.395
What is it?

00:06:19.648 --> 00:06:21.766
Do you still dare to object?

00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:23.246
I beg Father to revoke the decree.

00:06:23.247 --> 00:06:25.047
I would rather die than comply.

00:06:25.048 --> 00:06:25.686
Your Highness.

00:06:25.687 --> 00:06:26.928
I have already given my heart.

00:06:27.007 --> 00:06:28.087
I will never betray her.

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:29.087
Insolent!

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.446
Do you know how many merits
Wen Ling's father

00:06:31.447 --> 00:06:33.968
has rendered to the court?

00:06:34.162 --> 00:06:36.778
From now on, Que
will be under your discipline.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.020
I admit my guilt.

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:40.057
But this matter cannot be.

00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:41.124
You!

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:42.604
I beg Father's forgiveness.

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:00.561
Your Highness.

00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:01.674
Please return.

00:07:05.447 --> 00:07:07.127
I have waited for you all these years.

00:07:08.608 --> 00:07:10.127
Do you truly not know how I feel?

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.367
I am sorry.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.920
In this world,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.567
there is room in my heart
for only one person.

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:00.887
Your Highness, Young Lady Shen
asked me for joss paper.

00:08:00.968 --> 00:08:02.127
She said today

00:08:02.807 --> 00:08:04.567
marks the death anniversary
of her closest kin.

00:08:09.807 --> 00:08:11.048
Mother.

00:08:13.528 --> 00:08:14.928
Before you passed,

00:08:16.887 --> 00:08:18.968
you said all men in this world
are fickle.

00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:23.327
Yet I refused to believe it.

00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:28.048
Now it seems,

00:08:29.648 --> 00:08:31.207
how bitterly ironic.

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:37.808
He swore to protect me for a lifetime,

00:08:39.648 --> 00:08:41.887
to grow old with me, side by side.

00:08:44.408 --> 00:08:45.848
Yet in the end,

00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:49.568
I merely invited a wolf into my home,

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:54.760
and with his own hands,
he destroyed my entire family.

00:09:04.128 --> 00:09:05.167
That night,

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:10.407
I saw you collapse in a pool of blood.

00:09:10.528 --> 00:09:11.488
Mother.

00:09:12.447 --> 00:09:14.248
Mother.

00:09:15.048 --> 00:09:15.968
Mother.

00:09:17.288 --> 00:09:19.007
Qingru.

00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:21.007
Remember this.

00:09:21.168 --> 00:09:23.767
No matter what happens,

00:09:23.928 --> 00:09:26.726
you must live on, and live well.

00:09:26.727 --> 00:09:28.248
No.

00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:30.167
This jade pendant

00:09:31.528 --> 00:09:33.608
will keep you safe.

00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:37.086
Mother.

00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:38.848
I am utterly useless.

00:09:39.048 --> 00:09:41.248
I let you die such a cruel death.

00:09:43.727 --> 00:09:45.368
My greatest fault

00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:49.287
was believing a heartless man.

00:09:51.087 --> 00:09:53.208
I destroyed an entire family.

00:09:57.048 --> 00:09:57.968
Heng Dao.

00:09:59.648 --> 00:10:00.647
Go investigate for me

00:10:00.687 --> 00:10:02.328
who killed Ru's family.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:03.712
Yes.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.287
(Ru,)

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.328

00:10:15.037 --> 00:10:16.057
(your hatred.)

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.138
(But the truth of that night)

00:10:19.987 --> 00:10:21.490
(will one day)

00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:24.389
