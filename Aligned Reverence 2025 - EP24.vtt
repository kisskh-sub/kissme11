(You Are My Destiny)

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.979
Madam Xiao, please do not worry.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.739
Heir Qi said he will send us back

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.899
with dignity.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.099
I cannot wait any longer.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.760
She actually went
and started a rebellion!

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.659
This Su Jinyuan

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.259
really dared to overthrow everything!

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.500
And the Grand Madam really indulges her.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.179
Qi Sheng said that on the day
of his enthronement,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.200
he would officially
clear the Xiao family's injustice,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.840
and even invited us
to attend the ceremony.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.049
He told you but not me?

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.010
What is going on?

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.940
Does he have time to write to you
even after becoming Emperor?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.960
He still harbors evil intentions.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:50.911
He is too scheming,

00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:52.512
I dare not provoke him.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.900
Besides,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.020
my heart already belongs to someone.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.100
Xie Yunyan!

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.820
You two...

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.190
(Ever Lasting in History)

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.340
Xie Yunyan.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.020
How dare you stop me.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.324
Has that vixen Su Jinyuan

00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:56.695
bewitched you?

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.219
Mother,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.860
if you want to hit someone, hit me.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.980
I am the one who loves her.

00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:03.842
Xie Yunyan,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.820
has our Xiao family in all these years

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.660
ever mistreated you?

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.220
Did Yunxi mistreat you?

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.340
I have always treated you
like my own son.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.811
In this capital,

00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:18.659
what kind of woman can you not find?

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.486
Which family's daughter
can you not love?

00:03:20.487 --> 00:03:21.927
Why did you have to choose her?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.660
She is your sister-in-law!

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:26.961
Mother...

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:27.900
Be quiet!

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:34.012
Give me back the bracelet
for my eldest daughter-in-law.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.259
- The bracelet...
- Where is the bracelet?

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.260
The bracelet, I...

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.780
Did you lose my bracelet?

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.795
Su Jinyuan.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.707
What did Yunxi do in his past life

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.060
to be saddled with a woman like you?

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.820
You shame him again and again.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.940
You are absolutely shameless!

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.460
Mother!

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.060
I am the one who clings to her.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.980
I am the one
who refused to let her leave.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.900
She did nothing wrong to Yunxi.

00:04:13.137 --> 00:04:14.874
She and Yunxi were never married

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.640
and the divorce letter
has already been given.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.490
She became Young Madam Xiao

00:04:19.812 --> 00:04:21.379
for the sake of the Xiao family.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.620
The Xiao family cannot be her grave!

00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:31.432
Mother,

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.137
I beg you,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.179
if you take her
as your adopted daughter,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.780
then everything can be...

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.780
You want me to take her
as an adopted daughter,

00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:47.024
and then you two
will trample on Yunxi's reputation

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:48.705
and live happily ever after?

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.979
If I had known this,

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.260
I should never have taken you in!

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.900
Mother,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.820
it is my fault.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.460
I should not have fallen for Yan

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.260
while bearing the title
of Young Madam Xiao.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.410
I will leave the Xiao family.

00:05:24.837 --> 00:05:26.637
I will not bring disgrace

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:29.382
to the Xiao family or Yunxi.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.740
You are going to leave the Xiao family?

00:05:37.312 --> 00:05:39.232
I am not worthy

00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:41.405
to remain in the Xiao family.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.107
Who says you are not worthy?

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.845
Grand Madam.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.180
If she will not take you
as an adopted daughter,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.320
then I will take you as a granddaughter.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.380
You can marry whoever you wish.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.680
Grandmother...

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.149
Mother,

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.899
do not let Jinyuan leave!

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.420
Jinyuan, please do not go.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.700
You all cannot bear
to see her leave, is that right?

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.180
But who among you still remembers Yunxi?

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.940
My poor Yunxi

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.500
is being slandered even after his death.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.060
Fine. I am the wicked one.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.540
Only I am wicked.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.580
I am the wicked one!

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.870
Mother!

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.720
Mother!

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.140
Yunxi.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.420
Mother.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.980
Yunxi!

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.900
Mother.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.379
Yunxi, is that you?

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.740
It really is you!

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.740
Let me have a good look at you.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.019
Yunxi.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.180
Yunxi.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.740
Yunxi.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.859
Yunxi.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.380
Mother.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.860
Yunxi.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.220
Where exactly
have you been all this time?

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.420
You all knew Yunxi
was still alive a long time ago?

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.739
Yunxi actually returned a while ago,

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.780
but he was poisoned badly before

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.940
and did not know when he might...

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.060
He was afraid you would be sad,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.940
so he kept it hidden
from you all this time.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:45.819
Grandmother,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:46.900
Mother,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.820
I knew

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.300
about Yan and Yuan.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.860
And I agreed to it.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.420
This...

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.020
Consider this my plea to you,

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.620
please grant them your blessing.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.649
But everyone knows

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.769
Su Jinyuan is your wife.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.600
You will be mocked
for the rest of your life.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.195
Absolutely not!

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.060
But I

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.780
already have a wife.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.460
What?

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.780
Junning,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.740
come out.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.380
You...

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.740
Aren't you that physician?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.620
Yes.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.932
This...

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.339
Madam,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.220
you know my personality.

00:09:34.462 --> 00:09:35.770
In my eyes,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.700
he is not some young master
of the Xiao family.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.920
He is someone I snatched back
from the King of Hell,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.920
using all sorts of expensive medicinal herbs
and my superb medical skills.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.224
If you try to improperly
match him with a wife,

00:09:45.225 --> 00:09:46.505
I will not agree.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.180
This...

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.299
I will ask the new Emperor

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.620
to personally bestow
a marriage upon both couples.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.579
That way, no one
will dare speak ill of them.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.570
Is that

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.245
acceptable now?

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.419
This time,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.220
let me make the decision for them.

00:10:17.456 --> 00:10:20.200
(Xinglin Hall)

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.500
Goodbye.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.019
This sword

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.980
had crushed
the sixteen tribes of Nanyue.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.579
I want to go and try

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.540
if it can cut down
Nanyue medicinal herbs.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.599
The Xiao family

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.139
is now a new favorite of the court,

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.659
at the height of its power.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.199
And the Xiao family's private seal

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.120
can even mobilize the nation's troops.

00:10:49.162 --> 00:10:50.682
Are you truly willing to give that up?

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.249
The Imperial Court is too high,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.532
true feelings are rare there.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.499
It's not as good as the Jianghu,
with the clear moon and gentle breeze,

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.870
where one can live freely and happily.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.739
I wonder, Divine Physician Xi,

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.257
are you still in need of an apprentice?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.139
Yuan,

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.660
what is it that you desire?

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.060
Some return to the Jianghu to grow old,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.740
others take up arms
to defend the borders.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.480
What I desire is very simple,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.199
to love the one I love,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.707
and uphold the path I believe in.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.780
Then what do you want most right now?

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.740
I want to

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.507
marry Xie Yunyan.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.020
Report!

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.240
The Nanyue are attacking!

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.040
Xie Yunyan of the Xiao Manor
receives the decree.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.260
Set out for battle immediately!

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.900
Yuan,

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.900
wait for me to return.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.260
I will be with you.

00:13:55.625 --> 00:13:56.886
We will drink our wedding wine

00:13:56.887 --> 00:13:59.087
on the beacon tower at Linchuan.

00:14:10.796 --> 00:14:15.320
(Six months later)

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.757
You said if you had not run away
from the marriage then,

00:14:28.962 --> 00:14:30.437
if Yunxi had not gone to war,

00:14:30.725 --> 00:14:31.619
and if the Xiao family

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.357
had not gone through so much...

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.580
Would we have missed each other?

00:14:38.075 --> 00:14:39.195
No, we would not have.

00:14:39.662 --> 00:14:41.302
People who are destined to be together,

00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:43.095
even if they started a life over,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.460
would still find
their way back to each other.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.140
Actually, I always
have one regret in my heart.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.900
When I first met you that year,

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.380
why did I not tell you that

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.740
I love you?

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.740
And when was that?
