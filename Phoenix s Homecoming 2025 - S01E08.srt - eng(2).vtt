00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:58.950
=Episode 8=

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.719
The matter is grave.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.079
Don't speak recklessly.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.239
I, Li Jingche, am a prince with a brain.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:11.519
I received a military report

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:12.920
and went to the border.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.439
King Liang and Chancellor Huo

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.319
secretly colluded and ordered

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.920
Lu Chengfeng to sabotage
the south-pointing chariot,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.480
leading the troops to the gorge

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.400
to be surrounded by the Qi soldiers.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:28.439
That's why they lost.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.400
What a pity for the Sheng army.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:35.879
Those loyal ministers

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:37.799
and elite warriors

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:39.680
ended up

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.560
as the scapegoats for the defeat.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.239
By the time I arrived,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.760
the Sheng army
had been purged as traitors.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.000
I received tips from the border

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.680
that remnants of the Sheng army
were in the Qi State.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.639
But on my way there,

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.439
I heard that the Grand Princess perished

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.879
in the flames at the Weiyang Palace.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.199
So it was Chancellor Huo's doing.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.400
Such military achievements

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.919
made King Liang a matching opponent
to the Crown Prince.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.840
He wiped out the Sheng army.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.560
What an accomplishment.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.960
Although we serve

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.199
Chen and Qi, respectively.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.280
But we are being open and honest,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.520
and we share

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.759
the same goal.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.319
I always return a favor.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.039
Now that Your Highness saved my life,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.159
I am willing to
serve Your Highness with all my heart

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.039
to make sure that our states coexist

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.800
in harmony.

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:21.719
What a solemn pledge.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080
I mean it.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.599
Once we kill the schemers,

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:25.400
I intend to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.960
propose to you properly
and make you my wife.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.120
What now?

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.759
Seventeenth Prince,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.759
is this how you repay her kindness?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.840
By proposing to her?

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.120
Why not?

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.280
Should she marry you?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.719
Petty man.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.719
I didn't know there'd be a game
beyond Your Highness' fathom.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.439
Things change in the blink of an eye.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.439
One slip, and the whole game is lost.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240
Especially since

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.439
I'm using you as a chess piece.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.560
Don't worry about me.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.839
Even if things keep changing,

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.879
I will fight alongside you
to the bitter end.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:30.279
Your Highness, she's here.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.160
The fish is on the hook.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.639
Xie Fei.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:42.199
Your Majesty.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.439
Please get up.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.360
My brother,

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:05.759
have you grown distant from me?

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.120
I dare not cross the boundaries,
Your Majesty.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.600
Ever since you left the capital,

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.839
you've never once contacted me.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.279
To see you now

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.399
surely fulfills

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.000
my wish.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.879
Please forgive me.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.319
Do you still remember

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.800
our vow as kids?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.879
To support each other.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.959
I'll never forget it.

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:53.639
I remember that

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:56.480
Father forbade me sweets.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.839
But every time you visited,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.800
you'd bring me candied hawthorn

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.079
and novel trinkets from the market.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.360
I wonder

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.439
if you are still willing to help me?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.720
I dare not forget

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.720
our childhood bond.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.800
Naturally, I am willing
to share your burdens.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.800
I only wish

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:33.600
for Your Majesty to be happy.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.759
You know my situation well.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.839
I'm from a noble family,
but have no support.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.079
I'm the Empress,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.839
but His Majesty doesn't favor me.

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:56.439
I have no son to rely on.

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:59.720
In the imperial harem,

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.079
I walk alone on thin ice.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.120
If I hadn't recruited
some skilled people to serve me,

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:09.120
I would've died long ago.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.240
You're referring to...

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.279
The Ghost Fire.

00:07:15.904 --> 00:07:17.961
(Three years ago)

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.920
Who are you?

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.720
Did Chancellor Huo send you?

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:25.079
Help.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.920
Murder.

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:26.800
Help.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:45.839
Is he the one

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.560
who killed his own retainer?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.160
Exactly.

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:51.839
People have been gossiping about this.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.000
The case must have been
transferred to the Censorate.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.319
Well...

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:03.240
But since you requested it,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.759
I will see what I can do for you.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.199
With your words, my brother,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.560
I feel at ease.

00:08:12.928 --> 00:08:13.759
(Token)

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.360
I have little to offer in return.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.079
Please accept this token...

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.360
Your Majesty.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.399
Whatever you command,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.839
I certainly will fulfill

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.560
to my utmost ability.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:28.879
But I must follow family rules.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.600
Accepting it would invite

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.159
suspicion of factionalism.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.279
I would be failing my ancestors

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.288
and lying awake in shame.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.440
Please take it back, Your Majesty.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.240
After all these years,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.639
you haven't changed a bit.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.440
Very well.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.639
I won't trouble you

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.159
further.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:05.720
I await your good news.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480
Huaiyong.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.799
I think...

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.440
I think...

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.159
I regret it.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.360
Life is long.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.360
All mortals have regrets.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.919
Take care.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.480
"Huaiyong."

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:09.039
A hint of jealousy.

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:10.679
But

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:12.480
I like you

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.000
calling me that.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.279
You're standing so close to me.

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:20.639
Your lovely Huo Wan might get jealous.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.480
What's your plan with Huo Wan?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.360
Please enlighten me.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:37.200
Naturally, repay her in kind.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.080
She had fun imitating my handwriting.

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:46.159
Your Highness.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.919
Could you

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.679
call me Huaiyong once more?

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.799
Then I want candied hawthorn, too.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.840
Can someone show me a little concern?

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.720
Chancellor.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.159
Lord Xie Fei has arrived.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.240
Since resigning,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.159
I haven't visited you.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.639
How rude of me.

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.759
You've been running in
and out of my house

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.240
since childhood.

00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:45.559
I heard you've long sought the painting

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.120
Fishing by the River in Winter.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:50.480
I happened to find a copy.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.000
Though not as magnificent
as the original,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.360
the imitation captures its essence.

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:59.639
I hope you enjoy it.

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:11.720
This is a fine piece.

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:17.759
The mounting paper
must be from the palace?

00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:21.159
You're truly an expert, my lord.

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:22.879
But

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.879
I worry this gift may not be adequate.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.720
A gift from the Grand Tutor

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.440
is more than adequate.

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:36.440
It's just a token of my respect.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.279
I hope you like it.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:40.080
These days,

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:43.320
the capital faces turbulent times.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.480
You must be busy, my lord.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.440
I won't disturb you further.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.000
I take my leave.

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:03.960
Any updates?

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:06.639
A few days ago,

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.720
the Ghost Fire
killed his retainer in Zhuozhou

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.960
and caused quite a stir.

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:11.919
The Ghost Fire

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.279
was called Jia Cheng.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.080
He was the Grand Princess'
personal secretary

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.879
whom you sent someone to kill.

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:20.039
And Her Majesty

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.000
visited Grand Tutor Xie last night.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.080
Calm down, my lord.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.279
They ate what they shouldn't have

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.600
and entertained treacherous thoughts.

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:39.600
They're dead.
