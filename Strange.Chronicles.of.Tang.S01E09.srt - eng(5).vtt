[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.990
[Episode 9]

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.330
The one holding
the wooden tablet numbered three

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.130
may come forward and confess.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.280
[Three]

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.230
You both have such difficult lives.

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:25.990
I originally thought

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.590
that being born into the martial world

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.000
meant my fate was that of a wanderer—

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.120
I should wield my sword freely

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.150
and ride through mountains and rivers.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.410
Yet, I never expected,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.039
through twists of fate,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.020
to find the love of my life.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.479
My beloved

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.640
is one of the greatest minds of this age.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.340
Though

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.610
he is not very attentive toward me,

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.640
he's acceptable, I suppose.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.280
Yet... Yet I too have sorrows.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.840
My sorrow is this:

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.009
can he give me the home

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.950
I desire in my heart?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.479
If he can,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.320
could he please hurry up?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.590
If this drags on much longer,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.120
I'll be old before I know it!

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.790
To put it plainly,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.630
I hope to break free

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.760
from

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.240
the shackles of this dreamlike Chang'an
and ride away

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.900
on horseback with my beloved.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.680
Would he be willing to do so?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.050
If so,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.550
on what day

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.960
and in what year?

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.530
That's all.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.790
I still haven't had it as hard as you two.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.920
Thank you, Master.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.160
I've come many times

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.590
and finally have gotten the chance
to confess.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.310
I'm different from the others.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.750
I shall begin my confession

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750
with a story.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.080
Once upon a time,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.630
there was a country

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.030
called the Huai Kingdom.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.390
In this country lived a man named Xinba,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.520
who prided himself on his talents.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.710
After 10 years of arduous study,
he finally became a jinshi scholar

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.240
and was appointed to office
in the capital.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.430
The capital was divided into

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.430
northern and southern prefectures.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.680
Xinba served as prefect

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.630
of the south.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.560
However, the northern prefecture
had superior conditions:

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.680
it was naturally endowed with
wealth and prosperity.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.710
The southern prefecture was impoverished,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.170
with no signs of vitality.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.800
When Xinba first took office,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.200
he worried day and night,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.870
determined to revitalize
the southern prefecture.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.840
He then performed his duties diligently,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.970
worked tirelessly,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.590
attended to every matter personally,

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.920
and fulfilled all his responsibilities!

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.840
However,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.079
simply because the south was
less prosperous

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.590
and tax revenues fell short,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.230
his superiors

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.310
turned a blind eye to his dedication

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.440
and criticized him for incompetence!

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.150
He treasured the common people,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.030
yet not a single one of them

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.090
took him seriously as their prefect!

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.520
After two years,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.430
Xinba was exhausted

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.120
and unable to sleep at night.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.870
He often dreamed of
dying from overwork at his post,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.310
with no one to mourn him!

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.120
Such suffering!

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.680
Indeed, suffering...

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.120
-Suffering indeed.
-Suffering indeed.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.290
The one
holding the wooden tablet numbered five

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.990
may come forward to confess.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.920
Once you enter the palace,
it's as deep as the sea.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.240
Guards!

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.750
Take Su Wuming

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.470
away

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.360
and beat him to death with clubs!

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.020
In the past,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.900
there was a dynasty.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.960
Behind a pillar in the court

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.040
stood an obscure little eunuch.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.040
People say all eunuchs are treacherous,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.390
that their incomplete bodies

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.750
make them wicked.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.920
However,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.800
history has seen many eunuchs
who were loyal and virtuous.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.240
During the reign of Emperor He of Han,
there was Zheng Zhong,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.300
who helped the emperor eliminate
the Dou consort clan,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.360
ushering in a prosperous era
for the Han dynasty.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.600
There was also Cai Lun,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.630
who invented paper,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.490
benefiting generations to come.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.050
That little eunuch behind the pillar,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.890
though starting from nothing,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.600
was righteous

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.120
and had great ambition.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.240
He wished to assist the Emperor

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.570
in creating a golden age

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.830
and to overturn the world's

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.540
prejudice against eunuchs!

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.450
However,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.070
helping the Emperor

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.950
requires one who is wise, resolute,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.190
decisive, and efficient—

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.590
one who acts when needed.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.470
But instead, the Emperor

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.830
hesitated,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.370
wavered,

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.830
and time and again

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.360
missed his opportunities!

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.720
This led to power slipping away.

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.020
Even his throne

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.630
was in jeopardy.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.380
That eunuch,

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.240
though loyal, brave,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.890
insightful, and strategically skilled...

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.830
had no chance to put his talents to use.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.040
Instead, he suffered slander

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.480
and even

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.750
accusations of usurping power.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.720
He faced the threat of execution
at any moment.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.480
Tonight at the Confession Assembly,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.890
five confessors

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.050
have all finished their confessions.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.950
Master, please decide the final winner.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.070
Tonight, the one
who bears the greatest suffering is...

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.720
Lady Flatbread.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.270
Thus,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.630
the Demon-Slaying Ritual

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.830
will be performed by Lady Flatbread.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.920
[Abode of Transcendence]

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.480
Demon-Slaying Ritual,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.360

Your suffering

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.600
exceeds that of the other confessors.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.270
Therefore, the Master

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.320
has bestowed upon you the luck to slay

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320
the Demon of Woes!

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.960
Step forward

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.320
and swing your sword to cut off its head!

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.410
It's the Demon of Woes,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.810
a great evil!

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.600
All the troubles and anxieties

stem from this demon!

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.670

and for the rest of your life,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.910

You're finally awake.

Quickly, look—

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.540
which of these medicines
can save your life?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.830
Dissolve it in yellow wine

and apply it to my wound.

Xijun, hurry.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.250

How did it go?

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.010
By the time we reached
the Ascension Forest,

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.210
there was no one left!

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.390
The body was gone as well,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.390
devoured by the Ghost Birds!

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.120
Only a few bone fragments remained.

Along with pieces of black

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.560
What's frightening?

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.120
It's definitely not as terrifying

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.520
as what we've witnessed!

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.240
Official Lu,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.670
you should gather the officers

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.870
and destroy the Relief-from-Woes Shop!

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.440
What?

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.440
Yingtao,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.390
don't talk nonsense.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.850
But the one they killed...

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.510
Can't you tell?

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.000
Of course, I can tell.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.000
Official Lu,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.800
tonight Yingtao and I were at...

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.630
W-Why is there
such a strong smell of medicine?

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.640
It's Mr. Fei.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.490
Who is Uncle Fei treating?

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.130
He's not treating anyone.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.650
He's treating himself.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.500
Treating himself?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.360
Replenishing blood isn't

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.220
something that happens quickly.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.680
Xue Huan,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.840
go get another blanket and cover him.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.390
Keep him warm

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:03.810
so he can sleep longer.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.490
Alright.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.440
Yingtao.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.780
You can go keep an eye on
that place later. Now go.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.960
Xijun, you've worked hard.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.120
Why don't you take a break?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:20.630
No need.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.020
In another hour,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.670
I'll complete

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.070
Chen Shubao's portrait.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.390
I'll get back to drawing now.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.810
What Relief-from-Woes Shop?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.360
It's nothing but a place to
trick people out of their money.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.440
How did they manage to
swindle your gold coins?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.040
Su Wuming,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.510
you're not that old.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.240
How did you become so muddle-headed

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.570
and let others fool you?

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.750
You think the Yongzhou Prefecture Office

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.950
is full of gold coins?

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.240
This is the first time

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.000
I've used gold coins

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.120
since I became Chief of Secret Agents!

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.910
What's more, this Relief-from-Woes Shop

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.390
is definitely not as simple as you said—

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.150
merely a place to fleece people.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.530
There's something very strange about it.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.870
How strange exactly?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.840
Just their identities—

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.390
some of those

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.600
who come seeking relief

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.720
are

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.440
beyond imagination.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:07.780
Oh, right.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.030
This shop opens once every three days.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.630
Why don't we go together next time?

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.480
I have a feeling

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.120
that the word "Relief-from-Woes"

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.150
on that blood letter

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.550
refers to the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.080
It was just never finished.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.100
If what you say is true,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.360
then the Relief-from-Woes Shop

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.620
may indeed have caused multiple deaths.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.480
But when the office made its circuit
to Xiuzhen District,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.340
the only report

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.580
came from Lai, who is now missing.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:06.120
No...

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.550
No, you...

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.330
W-What do you people want now?

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.470
Murder for money, is that it?

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.840
I'm telling you,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.420
I'll yell for help!

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.480
I'll report you to the authorities!

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.630
Don't you know

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.440
he is with the authorities?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.000
Still, you can't break into
private residences

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.930
and kill people!

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.320
You scammed us out of our gold coins,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.960
and now you're acting innocent?

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.290
When did I ever scam you?

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.910
You paid for

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.480
the gold memberships willingly!

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.320
One gold coin

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.200
for two spots.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.610
I'm the one losing out here!

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.760
Let me ask you,

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.960
what exactly did you say at the time?

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.600
What do you mean?

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.550
Gold membership spots

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.570
are limited.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.480
According to the rules,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.390
only those who have paid for 100 visits

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.190
qualify to compete for one spot.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.920
But I have some connections,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.170
so I can

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:01.320
use worldly possessions—

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.840
like gold and silver—

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.210
to help those who want to vent publicly

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.600
and unburden their hearts

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.800
become gold members.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.550
I didn't say anything wrong!

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.210
I never said

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.510
that becoming a gold member

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.510
guaranteed you a chance to confess!

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.570
Quibbling!

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.430
I'll cut out your tongue! Try me!

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:16.910
I...

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.200
Come on, come on, come on!

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.650
Go ahead, cut it. Cut it!

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.750
If you cut out my tongue,

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.840
I'll write a blood letter!

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.600
I'll go report you to the Emperor!

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.440
You've written a blood letter before?

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.240
Well, no.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.460
That would hurt terribly.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.390
Yingtao.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.330
I just remembered.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.840
He really didn't guarantee

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.560
that everyone would have a chance
to confess.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.390
What?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.960
Su Wuming, you...

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.550
You know what?

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.440
You're actually quite reasonable.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.440
A gentleman desires wealth
but acquires it properly.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.060
You've tricked me twice already.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.390
But I admit you got me fair and square.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.480
You're becoming more and more reasonable.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.030
I almost want to be friends with you.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.760
That's exactly why I came—
to be friends with you.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.550
Last night, I didn't get a chance
to confess,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.910
and I couldn't sleep at all
after I went home.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.440
So,

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.870
I want to go there again.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.030
Sure.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.630
Gold members

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.320
enjoy this privilege for life.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.120
I want to...

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.360
bring more people with me.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.520
They all want gold memberships?

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.120
One gold coin

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.240
for each spot.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.610
You're not being much of a friend.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.270
Officer,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.870
friendship is one thing;

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.360
business is another.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.320
But I, Sheng, value loyalty above all.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.180
How about this?

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.670
One gold coin

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.950
for two spots.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:45.980
How's that?

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.910
You're forcing my hand here.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:50.550
I...

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.630
Yingtao,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.700
I'll leave this man to you.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.970
Dump the body

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.080
in Ascension Forest after dark.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.780
The body...

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:00.700
Hold on!

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.069
Fine! You win!

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.790
I'll do as you say!

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.400
Happy now?
