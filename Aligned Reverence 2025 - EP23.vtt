(I want to marry you honorably)

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:30.702
Xie Yunyan is completely reckless.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.660
Prince Yu had not even
been formally convicted,

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:36.905
yet he dared to poison the Prince Yu.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.980
Your Majesty,

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:41.525
I believe there are doubts
about this case.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.140
Caught with the evidence
and the culprit,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.139
what more is there to question?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.380
There is a great deal to question!

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.860
You...

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.860
Are you trying to start a rebellion?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.187
What is the real truth
behind the Xiao family's Linchuan case?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.220
Xie Yunyan did not
poison Prince Yu at all.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.340
Prince Yu is indeed dead,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.961
but his loyal subordinate,

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:31.402
Tan Xu, is still here.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.660
I treated Prince Yu generously.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.020
Do not make reckless accusations.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.819
Your Majesty was generous to my master,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.795
but only because my master

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.690
carried out many foul deeds for you!

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.380
Poisoning the late Emperor,

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:53.137
usurping the throne,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.700
and poisoning old General Xiao!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.180
And you?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.659
The moment things went wrong,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.220
you immediately poisoned
my master without hesitation!

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.420
Unfortunately, my master

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:05.837
had foreseen this outcome.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.460
(For Prince Yu)
These

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.340
are all the evidence.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.700
This

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.379
is the Edict of Succession
from the late Emperor.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.120
(Prince Duan is fit
to inherit the throne and carry on my will.)

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.179
My father, Prince Duan,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.780
is the one who should be
the current Emperor!

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.300
You...

00:03:43.812 --> 00:03:46.252
Since the late Emperor's Edict
has been clearly revealed,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.779
I ask all officials

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.299
to join me

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.049
in restoring the legitimate line
and correcting the imperial government.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.899
Your Lordship is righting the wrongs.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.900
We await Your Lordship's command!

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.220
We await Your Lordship's command!

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.020
Xiao Yingting.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.357
You promised me

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.740
that this Edict would never
see the light of day.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.660
My leniency

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.260
allowed Xiao family to linger on.

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:22.505
I should never have agreed
to spare them.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.740
I should have

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.699
exterminated the Xiao family

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.060
entirely!

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.980
Take him away!

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.500
Investigate the Linchuan case thoroughly!

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.460
Release me!

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.220
Su Jinyuan.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.020

Xie Yunyan?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.700
Too bad.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.260
He is already dead.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.860

you would stay alive.

Xie Yunyan was dead, did you?

Do not worry.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:18.859
I'm here

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.620

I succeeded.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.820
We no longer need
to fear the Qing Emperor.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.460
what have you done?

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.174
She was willing to risk her life

00:08:13.175 --> 00:08:14.935
just to bring Emperor Qing down.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:16.924
The one who is Emperor now

00:08:16.925 --> 00:08:18.725
must be that Qi Sheng.

00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:21.761
The truth of the Linchuan case

00:08:21.762 --> 00:08:23.802
will be revealed immediately.
