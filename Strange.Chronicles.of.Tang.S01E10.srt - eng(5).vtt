[Strange Chronicles of Tang]

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.020
[Episode 10]

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.099
What's the happy occasion today?

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.200
To serve at Your Majesty's side

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.420
is my every day joy.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.070
No, that's not it.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.500
You've been frowning lately,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.980
but you're smiling today.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.840
Did something good happen?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.000
Tell me, so I can be happy too.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.310
Nothing special.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.590
It's just that...

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.370
I went to a place yesterday

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.000
called Relief-from-Woes Shop.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.270
You can share your woes

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480
and all of it will vanish instantly.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.270
There is such a place?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.200
Yes.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.210
I can only say

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.870
the only way to relieve your woes

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.000
is to visit the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.200
Can you take me there?

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.229
Your Majesty.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590
This shop is in the remote area of
Xiuzhen District.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.560
You can't go there, Your Majesty.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.310
Why not?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.070
I also have troubles weighing on my heart

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.479
that I need to get off my chest.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.710
All of us are witnesses to it
as your servants

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.039
and it pains our hearts,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.600
but...

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.310
a place like the Relief-from-Woes Shop

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.870
is only suitable

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.400
for people like us to visit.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.560
Your Majesty's safety

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.590
is the foundation of the Tang Empire.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.000
We cannot risk any mishap.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.070
Besides, you need to exchange passwords

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.000
and wear a mask.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.000
So...

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.880
So that sounds interesting.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.310
Once I wear a mask,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.770
no one will recognize who I am.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.420
If you can't recognize me,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.060
neither can those who wish to harm me.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.740
Therefore, safety won't be an issue.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.760
Here in Tang Empire's Chang'an,

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.590
peace reigns all too well.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.440
That still won't do!

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.680
It's all my fault

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.560
for speaking nonsense.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.150
I deserve a beating!

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.310
He looks familiar.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.630
I just can’t seem to recall it right away.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.240
Isn't this Ruiqiu's husband,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.060
Chen Qian?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.310
No wonder he looked so familiar.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.430
It is Chen Qian.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.079
Who drew this?

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.150
It looks so much like him.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.800
Ruiqiu,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.680
the female Master of Rain?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680
Yes, she's the Madam Master of Rain.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.750
Where does she live?

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.520
Over there.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.270
Anyone there?

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.960
Yongzhou Judicial Office here for a case!

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.030
Official Lu.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.079
Magistrate Xin.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.290
You're here for a case?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.490
You'll have to wait.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.430
What I'm currently discussing with Ruiqiu

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.470
is no small matter either.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.079
It might even be more significant
than the case

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.410
you're investigating.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.670
Ruiqiu,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.360
to put it simply,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.270
I want you to select

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.000
some beautiful woman who possess

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
natural grace and charm from

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.030
within the district.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.520
Perhaps five, seven, or nine of them,

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.030
practice some dance routines together,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.710
and perform in all districts of Chang'an.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:41.590
We could name it

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680
Xiuzhen District's
Madam Master of Rain Dance Troupe.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.210
This way,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.870
we can attract more people,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.750
especially the officials and nobles

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.870
from Wannian County.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:48.730
Let's make them

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.910
buy houses here,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.240
practice cultivation here,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.280
and dine and wine here.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.030
Then this desolate Xiuzhen District

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.960
will become prosperous, won't it?

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.120
As for your wages,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.660
it will be covered entirely by
Chang'an County.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.260
Of course,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.710
masks cannot be worn during performances.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.470
This is very important.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.200
Magistrate,

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.840
this won't work.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.030
Why not?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.680
I have given this careful thought.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.990
I can make you

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.270
the most famous woman in Chang'an.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.430
But I don't want

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.760
to be that kind of woman.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.360
Well...

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.360
Ruiqiu,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.510
why don't you give it another thought?

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.510
District Head Li,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.120
back in that year of severe drought,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.800
Chang'an saw only

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.130
a handful of rainfalls.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.310
But Xiuzhen District

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.120
didn't receive a single drop of rain.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120
It was not long after my father's passing.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.310
The neighbors all blamed me

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.800
because our Master of Rain family
had no male heir.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.310
That's why I had to steel myself,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.060
put on a mask,
and performed the rain prayer ritual.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.990
Indeed, indeed.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.360
That night, heavy rain fell in Chang'an,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.920
and Xiuzhen District

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.070
received the most rainfall.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.950
Otherwise, Chang'an

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.050
wouldn't have

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.850
a female Master of Rain, right?

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.040
The previous time,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.510
when you asked me to remove my mask,

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.480
I already did.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.750
But asking me to lead several women

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.080
and go out there dancing

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.820
is quite the challenge for me.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.600
My husband is preparing for his exams.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.800
I need to cook for him.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
Is your husband's name is Chen Qian?

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.720
Yes.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.950
Come over here and look at this painting.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.870
Is he this man?

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.550
Who painted this?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.240
It looks a lot like him.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.900
Where is he?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.870
Where is he now?

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.890
He's sleeping inside.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.680
Sleeping?

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.310
The Magistrate comes to your home,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.920
and yet your husband is sleeping?

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.450
Isn't that inappropriate?

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.680
He studied all night

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.680
and is exhausted.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.159
When the Magistrate arrived,

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.290
I wanted to wake him,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.390
but the Magistrate said
it wasn't necessary.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.190
That's right.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.830
I came to discuss matters with Ruiqiu.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.040
I don't care if her husband

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.170
is sleeping inside.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.570
Isn't this how a gentleman should behave?

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.920
Of course.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.360
That's how it should be.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.750
The Magistrate is down-to-earth

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.480
and doesn't fuss about minor details.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.750
I admire that.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.700
Ruiqiu.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.170
Let me ask you again.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.260
Besides preparing for the exam,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.870
does your husband
do anything else for a living?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.680
He worked as a courier for a while.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
I told him it was too exhausting,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.140
so I persuaded him to quit.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.670
Is he really sleeping inside?

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.240
If not,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.950
Madam Master of Rain,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.840
have you thought about
how to cover up your lie?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.680
The Magistrate is at my home.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.080
How could I possibly lie?

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.920
Since you're so eager to see my husband,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.830
please wait a moment.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.890
I'll go wake him up.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:56.810
Chen Shubao!

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.360
Didn't you meet a wealthy young lady

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.310
while delivering something

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.620
to Xuanyang District,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.360
and planned to enjoy

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.760
a life of luxury with her?

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.630
What's your intention

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.480
of saying such things

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.540
in front of my wife?

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.120
I...

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.040
-Didn’t you say your wife…
-Shut up!

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.310
I'll admit

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.830
Ruiqiu and I had a disagreement.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.430
I was upset

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.870
and said some things outside

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.130
that I shouldn't have.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.040
But my wife and I have reconciled now.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.160
Why are you stirring up trouble?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.600
I...

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.310
Besides, my name isn't Chen Shubao.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.630
That was just an alias.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.070
After all, it's not dignified

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.240
for a scholar to work as a courier.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.840
Su Wuming.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.040
Do you recognize this clothing?

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.120
This clothing?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.510
He was suddenly wearing a new outfit

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.240
when he returned the other day,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.909
so I was very curious.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.790
Where did you get this from?

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.750
I got it from a secondhand store.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.430
How much?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.580
A few dozen wen.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.870
Just three days' worth of wages
as a courier.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.600
My husband, you must be joking.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.780
Just this turquoise knot button
on the collar

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.980
is worth far more than a few hundred wen.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.880
That expensive?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.680
I had suspected that

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.720
he had stolen it while delivering packages

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.450
for the Express Delivery Shop.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.830
Yes.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.000
My dear,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.360
I've disgraced you.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:31.750
I...

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.750
I'm so ashamed.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.320
That day after our big fight,

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.240
I took

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.000
this clothing

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.320
and hung it in Ascension Forest.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.030
I was afraid the shopkeeper
would report it

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.960
and catch us with the stolen goods.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.720
But after a couple of days, I thought,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.780
since my husband had already worn it,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.430
hanging it there
would be like cursing him.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.410
So I went back to Ascension Forest

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.470
and pulled it down.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.680
But in my haste,

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.720
the most valuable turquoise knot button

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.720
came off.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.120
I searched everywhere
but couldn't find it,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.120
so I had to give up.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.830
After that...

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.570
No way!

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.320
Xiuzhen District's Madam Master of Rain!

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.840
To see

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.480
your true face, Madam Master of Rain,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.360
I purposely waited for you

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.360
to remove your mask after the performance.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.510
So I recognize you.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.880
You are?

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.000
I am the shopkeeper of
Lady Hong's Secondhand Store.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.710
Today, I'm collecting old items
in the district.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.000
[Mr. Zuo, Lady Hong's Secondhand Store]

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.910
Are you selling

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.870
this robe?

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.390
My husband was going to return

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.550
this piece of clothing.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.870
I am the one who took it upon myself

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.270
and sold it as a used item.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.320
If someone must be punished,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.030
I'll take it on behalf of my husband.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.000
If there's a fine,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.200
we're willing to pay.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.000
Official Lu.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.630
That shopkeeper, Mr. Dai,

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.230
who murdered his own nephew,

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.340
has confessed?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.200
He had confessed.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.750
So this robe was stolen property
to begin with,

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.000
and was even worn by a dead man.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.530
It's not worth much anyway.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.690
As for you,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.120
doing something like this

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.270
as a scholar

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.750
is completely unacceptable.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.670
I, the Magistrate,

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.200
officially reprimand you.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:00.750
Yes.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.060
I acknowledge my mistake.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.000
Official Lu,

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.870
I think we should let this matter go.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.040
After all, it's not a serious offense.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.840
Ruiqiu,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.670
about what I discussed with you earlier,

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.130
please think it over carefully.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:17.610
By then,

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.120
I will invite people
from Pingkang District

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.520
and the Persian Pavilion

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.840
and put on Chang'an's

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.570
most beautiful makeup for you.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.870
That Chen Qian,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.290
in terms of appearance,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.750
does match Hu's description of

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.080
Chen Shubao perfectly.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.520
But I still feel something's not right.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.600
Look at him,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.370
there's no hint of slyness.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.120
He doesn't seem like someone

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.520
who's been running errands
for half a year.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.600
Chen Qian,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.390
Ruiqiu's Rain Master's Dance

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.270
matters greatly

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.320
to Xiuzhen District and

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.360
all of Chang'an County.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.030
You must persuade her

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.290
to accept my proposal.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.200
In your day-to-day,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.730
take good care of your wife.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.630
Don't let her cook for you

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.970
or get injured again.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.790
Look at her forehead.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.760
I understand.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.120
I've noted everything.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.550
Please rest assured, Magistrate.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.280
Official Lu,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.840
I will take Chen Qian and Ruiqiu

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.570
back for further questioning.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.390
Nonsense!

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.030
Don't you see Magistrate Xin is here?

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.360
Even if he weren't here,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.760
you can't just arrest people
as you please.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:28.870
Yes.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.640
How I yearn for you,
yet you're in Chang'an.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.630
Rumors say I'm ordered to guard
the garrisons in Gaolan.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.000
Longcheng is far,
and the garrisons are cold.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.530
Sorrows makes one thinner,

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.920
and the belt naturally becomes loose.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.270
Chen Qian,

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.610
what were those last two lines again?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.600
I haven't read this poem, Sir.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.240
Enough.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.100
Such a vulgar poem,

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.400
yet you keep reciting it, Official Lu.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.600
Ridiculous.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.680
I do remember the last two lines though.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.320
As I think of you who's not here now,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.750
who will now embrace my waist?

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.090
It's a bit vulgar,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.000
but still quite catchy.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.440
Chen Qian,

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.970
where are you from?

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.110
My ancestral home is Xu County
in Yingchuan,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.240
but I was born in Lantian, Yongzhou.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.210
Magistrate.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.210
W-Why don't you two chat first,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.820
and we'll leave you alone.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.200
Farewell.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:44.790
Hu.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:47.920
Officer.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.120
You said yesterday that Chen Shubao

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.670
loves reading Collected Poems of Xu Ling.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.320
Are you sure you didn't get it wrong?

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.120
Yes, I'm sure.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.240
If you don't believe me,
ask our boss again.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.640
I remember it was Xu Ling,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.360
that poet from the Southern Dynasties.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360
Are you certain

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.240
that man just now was Chen Shubao?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:03.910
Yes.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.170
I-I think so.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.960
In front of his wife,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.480
he acts like a decent person.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.000
When he hangs out with us,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.960
he's not nearly this proper.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:16.990
All right.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.740
Thank you for your trouble.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.120
This...

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.630
The portrait took you all night.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.830
This is extra payment from Official Lu.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.970
Thank you, Officer.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.850
Official Lu.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.000
Just now...

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.090
Should I not have interrupted?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.270
You did well.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:36.970
Xue Huan,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.210
take this portrait to Lantian

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.140
and investigate this Chen Qian.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.550
Yes.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.480
He often reads Collected Poems of Xu Ling,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.790
yet he doesn't know Xu Ling's poems.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.270
That's very suspicious.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.850
Official Lu.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.190
You're getting better and better at

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.480
tracking down clues these days.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.770
That's because Xijun reminded me.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.380
A skilled portrait artist

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.840
can observe and capture both

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.750
the form and spirit of

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.550
their subject in the shortest time

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.960
This man's appearance is right,
but his spirit is wrong,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.490
isn't it?

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.430
It's just a feeling I had.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.450
So it's because Xijun was

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.240
helping you secretly.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:24.550
Yin.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.480
I am the Emperor,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.720
yet often I have no freedom.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.550
In this palace,

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.800
there are few people I can truly trust.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.360
Is something on your mind, Your Majesty?

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.820
Please feel free to ask me.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.670
You're so clever.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.840
I've heard

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.930
there's a good place in Xiuzhen District

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.240
called the Relief-from-Woes Shop.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.550
I want to visit

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.760
but don't want too many people to know.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.240
After all, bringing too many guards

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.380
would take away the goodness

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.230
from this good place.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.400
But I'm not certain if this
Relief-from-Woes Shop

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.750
is safe.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.320
Understood.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.880
I, Yin, will scout ahead for Your Majesty.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.080
The gastrodia powder brewed today

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.480
was especially fragrant and sweet.
