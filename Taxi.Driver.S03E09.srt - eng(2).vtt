- Oh, no! - Hey. Look at you, all grown up.

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:27.265
- Ignoring my calls now, are we? - Why did you suddenly call me?

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:29.564
I called you several times, but you kept looking at your phone.

00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:31.135
What else was I supposed to do? I had to call you.

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:34.405
- What is it? - I'm making coffee. Want some?

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:46.115
You'll pay for this. All of it. For my concert tickets!

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:49.215
So you were trying to get tickets.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:51.425
It must be nice. At least your favourite has concerts.

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:56.055
My guy hasn't had a concert in forever.

00:01:56.755 --> 00:01:58.195
He's all about that mystique, you know?

00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:02.135
What's the point of a concert if I can't even go?

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:05.965
How much longer do I have to wait? These will be sold out in a minute.

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:18.485
No, I think you have the wrong person.

I'm Rainbow Rocks.

Hi, there.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.425
Great, you made it. I don't need to check it, right?

00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:30.595
Right. Since I came myself, the price is firm.

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:32.294
It'll be 120 dollars, including transportation costs.

00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:33.465
Sure.

00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:37.365
Of course. I won't haggle. Here is 120 dollars.

really love this song.

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:26.365
I like this song too.

00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:28.675
- Really? - Yes.

00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:30.335
I listened to it a lot when I was in the army.

00:05:34.215 --> 00:05:38.085
It was the first song I learned all the choreography for.

00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:42.715
If you learned the whole dance, you must have really loved it.

00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:48.195
When I listen to this song,

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:51.195
it feels like I'm on a stage.

00:05:58.305 --> 00:05:59.565
was to become an idol star.

00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:03.475
When I listen to this song,

00:06:05.205 --> 00:06:06.545
it's as if it's telling me...

00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:10.745
that it's okay to have that dream.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:19.525
An amazing idol who gives their all to give people hope,

00:06:20.525 --> 00:06:21.625
cheers them on,

00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:26.695
and sometimes even comforts them.

00:06:28.935 --> 00:06:30.335
That's a really wonderful dream.

00:06:31.635 --> 00:06:33.065

Fortunately, they said it's not life-threatening.

00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:42.125
That's a relief.

00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:43.995
But according to the medical staff,

00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:46.765
her blood work shows signs of malnutrition.

00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:49.095

I know you'll believe me.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:35.345
But the thought of your dreams being ruined because of me...

00:10:36.315 --> 00:10:37.945
is worse than death.

00:10:39.685 --> 00:10:42.255
I'll take all the darkness and filth with me.

00:10:43.315 --> 00:10:45.185

00:11:02.275 --> 00:11:03.775
So she didn't do it, but was accused of it?

00:11:04.945 --> 00:11:06.245
Was she framed?

00:11:14.355 --> 00:11:15.355

Yes, you're very much alive.

- Gosh. Miss. - Just a moment.

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:11.175
- You can't. - Get changed so we can go, okay?

00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:14.415
Sir, she still needs to get some more rest.

She's awake, isn't she?

00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:20.345
You said her test results were fine. I don't see what the problem is.

- No, but even so... - I...

00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:28.125
- I'd like to be discharged. - See? She says so herself.

What? Just tell me!

00:16:48.585 --> 00:16:50.385
They saw the video we submitted last week.

00:16:52.055 --> 00:16:53.925
They want us to audition in person!

00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:58.295
- Oh, my gosh. - This is crazy!

00:17:01.595 --> 00:17:02.735
Look at this.

00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:09.505
- Gosh, I'm so nervous. Oh, my gosh. - Gosh. Hey.

00:17:13.445 --> 00:17:16.045
What if we become like them someday? That's insane.

00:17:16.345 --> 00:17:17.845
- I can't believe it. - Seriously.

00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:20.645
Hey, hold on! You remember the routine, right?

00:17:20.715 --> 00:17:22.485
- Let's run through it real quick. - And go!

00:17:22.555 --> 00:17:24.355
- It'll never happen - It'll never happen

00:17:24.415 --> 00:17:26.325
- But my heart fluttered a little - But my heart fluttered a little

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:54.485
You've practised a lot.

00:17:55.385 --> 00:17:56.755
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:59.685
Look at how stiff they are.

00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:02.025
They were so fluid when they were dancing.

00:18:02.955 --> 00:18:06.625
You can relax. You did so well that I'm tempted to pick you.

00:18:07.325 --> 00:18:08.395
Come closer.

00:18:10.795 --> 00:18:14.365
But you're both high school seniors. Shouldn't you be studying?

00:18:14.935 --> 00:18:17.205
Just you know, if you sign with us, you have to drop out.

00:18:17.475 --> 00:18:18.675
You can't do both school and work.

00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:22.675
It's the same at other agencies, but training alone takes all day.

00:18:23.715 --> 00:18:26.285
Take a few days and let me know your decision.

00:18:26.885 --> 00:18:29.485
This is your life we're discussing, so think it over carefully.

00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:31.985
I'll drop out.

00:18:32.685 --> 00:18:34.725
I want this so much, I'm willing to give it my all.

00:18:35.925 --> 00:18:38.465
- I'll drop out too. - Goodness.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:43.735
Go home and talk with your parents.

00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:46.205
And if you still feel the same way,

00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:49.075
pack your bags and come back next week.

00:18:52.445 --> 00:18:53.675
Oh, my gosh!

00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:56.645
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

00:18:56.815 --> 00:18:58.815
Lucky you. You must be thrilled.

00:18:59.085 --> 00:19:00.415
- This is amazing. - My gosh.

00:19:00.845 --> 00:19:02.915
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:03.985
We did it!

00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:09.555
Mom, you have to listen to me!

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:12.625
Quiet! I'm busy, don't make a scene. Sir, I'm here.

00:19:13.265 --> 00:19:15.465
There you go. Enjoy your meal.

00:19:16.065 --> 00:19:18.205
Hey! You think anyone can become an idol?

00:19:18.905 --> 00:19:21.405
- Hey, there! Number one, Sapphire. - Yes.

00:19:21.475 --> 00:19:23.004
- Sapphire! - I told you.

00:19:23.005 --> 00:19:24.435
You can sing your heart out here.

00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:26.374
Why do you talk to me like that?

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:28.715
I'm risking my entire life for this!

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:31.685
Oh, please. "Your life"? What do you even know about life?

00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:33.644
Gosh, I'm busy, so just go. Okay?

00:19:33.645 --> 00:19:35.455
Go eat, then hit the books. Got it?

00:19:36.715 --> 00:19:40.655
Hello? Yes. How many are in your party?

00:19:49.335 --> 00:19:50.435
Lee Ro Mi!

00:19:58.445 --> 00:19:59.875
How did it go with your mom?

00:20:00.945 --> 00:20:02.215
You know her. She's always busy.

00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:04.374
What about you? How did the talk with your parents go?

00:20:04.375 --> 00:20:06.185
How do you think it went?

00:20:07.985 --> 00:20:11.185
Hey, you know what I told my mom when I stormed out with my suitcase?

00:20:11.425 --> 00:20:14.225
- What did you say? - That when I'm on TV,

00:20:14.355 --> 00:20:17.255
I screamed I'd let her put my face on her pig's feet restaurant sign!

00:20:18.065 --> 00:20:19.095
Gosh.

00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:25.835
You should do it too. Promise her your face for her karaoke sign.

00:20:25.935 --> 00:20:27.135
- Go on, scream it! - Be quiet.

00:20:27.265 --> 00:20:28.475
What's the big deal?

00:20:28.835 --> 00:20:31.035
- Are you nuts? Why? - What?

00:20:31.075 --> 00:20:33.905
(Trainee Contract, Lee Ro Mi)

00:20:45.655 --> 00:20:47.055
(Training and activity costs)

00:20:47.125 --> 00:20:48.395
(Costs are based on 2023 rates and can change.)

00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:49.855
(1. Dance lessons: 500 dollars per hour)

00:20:52.565 --> 00:20:54.935
- Excuse me. - What is it?

00:20:55.795 --> 00:20:57.265
Do we have to...

00:20:57.965 --> 00:21:00.165
pay these fees ourselves?

00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:01.405
I'm sorry,

00:21:02.105 --> 00:21:03.805
but we don't have any money.

00:21:04.875 --> 00:21:06.145
Of course you don't.

00:21:07.145 --> 00:21:08.645
You're students. Where would you get money?

00:21:09.815 --> 00:21:13.485
We'll cover everything listed there for now.

00:21:13.685 --> 00:21:17.855
We're investing in your dreams, though your future is uncertain.

00:21:19.025 --> 00:21:20.855
But of course, it's not free.

00:21:22.195 --> 00:21:23.325
You'll have to pay it back later.

00:21:23.855 --> 00:21:27.125
After you successfully debut and become stars.

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:29.265
You understand what I'm saying, right?

00:21:29.535 --> 00:21:31.505
- Yes. - Yes.

00:21:32.635 --> 00:21:34.135
If you understand, then sign them.

00:21:43.015 --> 00:21:47.415
(Name: Lee Ro Mi)

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:51.625
Well, well. If it isn't our passionate GED candidates.

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:54.385
- Hey. - Hello.

00:21:56.555 --> 00:21:58.965
Starting today, the five of you will be training together.

00:21:59.425 --> 00:22:00.625
You'll be sharing a dorm too.

00:22:01.425 --> 00:22:02.495
Really?

00:22:03.935 --> 00:22:06.035
So the whole team is finally together.

00:22:06.535 --> 00:22:08.205
Now we just have to nail our debut prep.

00:22:08.675 --> 00:22:12.545
Ro Mi will be the leader for now since she's the oldest.

00:22:13.505 --> 00:22:17.375
Manager Song will explain the rules. Listen carefully so you know them.

00:22:18.285 --> 00:22:19.745
- Okay. - Let's do this!

00:22:19.815 --> 00:22:21.715
- Shall we head to the dorm? - Yes.

00:22:22.055 --> 00:22:23.085
All right, this way.

00:22:24.985 --> 00:22:26.125
Let's go.

00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:44.305
- Girls, grab your bags quickly. - Okay.

00:22:44.605 --> 00:22:47.245
- Should we help her with that? - What is it?

00:22:47.545 --> 00:22:49.015
- My suitcase... - I see.

00:22:51.075 --> 00:22:52.085
Here.

00:23:05.525 --> 00:23:06.895
Great.

00:23:08.165 --> 00:23:09.835
All right, let's get a focus clap!

00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:12.405
Focus! Come on, let's focus.

00:23:12.465 --> 00:23:13.465
Let's get a focus clap!

00:23:13.805 --> 00:23:15.035
- Focus! - There we go.

00:23:15.335 --> 00:23:19.145
All right. You need permission every time you leave.

00:23:19.305 --> 00:23:23.545
Your phones and any internet devices must be turned in after 8pm.

00:23:23.575 --> 00:23:26.644
No personal activities allowed except for work schedules.

00:23:26.645 --> 00:23:27.645
Also...

00:23:27.715 --> 00:23:29.555
Doesn't it feel like we've already debuted?

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:32.225
- It doesn't feel real at all. - This is insane.

00:23:32.285 --> 00:23:33.285
Hey.

00:23:34.185 --> 00:23:36.155
- Let's zip our lips. Zip! - Zip!

00:23:38.195 --> 00:23:41.065
You'll weigh in every morning and report to me.

00:23:41.365 --> 00:23:44.435
Personal diaries or notes may be checked during room checks.

00:23:44.495 --> 00:23:47.735
Also, any complaints, grievances, or any stress you have...

00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:51.475
must never be shared outside. What about your parents?

00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:54.105
Absolutely not.

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:55.375
- Understood. - Understood.

00:23:55.515 --> 00:23:56.515
Manager Song.

00:23:57.245 --> 00:23:59.315
- Are you a Thinker Type? - Yes, when I work.

00:24:00.645 --> 00:24:02.985
Why are you being so cold to them?

00:24:03.455 --> 00:24:05.785
You're killing the vibe for our angels here.

00:24:06.485 --> 00:24:07.525
Listen up, girls.

00:24:07.755 --> 00:24:12.665
Worst rumours are usually started by close friends or even parents.

00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:16.395
What if you're careless and tell all just because you're close?

00:24:16.735 --> 00:24:19.665
It'll come back to stab you in the back.

00:24:20.735 --> 00:24:22.335
- Gosh. - That would hurt, wouldn't it?

00:24:25.345 --> 00:24:26.805
From this moment on,

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:29.915
you're BLACKPINK and aespa to me.

00:24:30.815 --> 00:24:32.715
If you really want to be idols,

00:24:34.215 --> 00:24:36.015
you need to start living like idols right now.

00:24:38.215 --> 00:24:40.325
- Understood? - Yes, sir!

00:24:43.825 --> 00:24:45.065
Was I a little too icy?

00:24:46.825 --> 00:24:48.935
- Did you start the car? - Oh, right.

00:24:52.535 --> 00:24:54.565
Everything felt so new and wondrous.

00:24:55.335 --> 00:24:56.675
It all felt like a dream.

00:24:57.305 --> 00:24:59.705
Five, six, seven, go.

00:24:59.775 --> 00:25:04.315
One, two, three, four, five, six, hit it and two.

00:25:04.475 --> 00:25:06.415
Every day was gruelling,

00:25:07.185 --> 00:25:09.885
but my team and I,

00:25:10.585 --> 00:25:12.285
worked harder than anyone else.

00:25:14.155 --> 00:25:15.425
Push harder!

00:25:16.295 --> 00:25:18.025
And so, one month passed.

00:25:18.395 --> 00:25:20.225
- Three! - Go on!

00:25:20.495 --> 00:25:21.495
Two months.

00:25:26.365 --> 00:25:27.365
Five months.

00:25:28.805 --> 00:25:32.105
You're in a girl group, and you weigh over 40kg?

00:25:32.375 --> 00:25:35.875
What, you want the fans to call you pigs?

00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:37.615
- We're sorry. - Excuse us.

00:25:38.845 --> 00:25:39.885
Excuse me for a moment.

00:25:43.455 --> 00:25:46.625
Hey, you! Answer me. Why don't you answer me?

00:25:46.655 --> 00:25:48.055
I said, do you want to be called pigs?

00:25:48.955 --> 00:25:50.325
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

00:25:51.295 --> 00:25:52.795
Until you all get down to 38kg,

00:25:53.565 --> 00:25:55.335
you're all on a strict diet. Understand?

00:25:55.865 --> 00:25:58.165
- Yes. - I can't hear you!

00:25:58.235 --> 00:25:59.265
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

00:26:10.175 --> 00:26:11.175
A Ra.

00:26:11.515 --> 00:26:12.515
Oh, Ro Mi.

00:26:14.485 --> 00:26:15.755
What am I going to do?

00:26:16.815 --> 00:26:18.055
Ro Mi.

00:26:18.985 --> 00:26:21.055
I'm so hungry.

00:26:21.995 --> 00:26:24.295
Please, you have to help me.

00:26:25.595 --> 00:26:26.725
It's okay.

00:26:27.025 --> 00:26:29.665
Just eat something. We can work out extra later.

00:26:38.845 --> 00:26:39.875
I...

00:26:40.975 --> 00:26:45.885
will not eat the banana.

00:26:47.245 --> 00:26:48.585
For over a year,

00:26:50.085 --> 00:26:54.155
we trained like our lives depended on it.

00:26:59.495 --> 00:27:01.865
(Dance Studio)

00:27:07.565 --> 00:27:08.775
Hey, everyone, focus!

00:27:09.505 --> 00:27:10.535
Soo Jung, kill the music.

00:27:15.915 --> 00:27:16.975
Girls.

00:27:17.615 --> 00:27:18.845
The CEO wants to see you.

00:27:21.385 --> 00:27:22.455
Everyone, follow me.

00:27:23.015 --> 00:27:24.055
- Okay. - Okay.

00:27:56.115 --> 00:27:57.885
- Elements! - Elements!

00:28:01.455 --> 00:28:03.525
So? Do you like it?

00:28:04.125 --> 00:28:07.295
- Yes, I love it. - Me too.

00:28:07.995 --> 00:28:12.305
We'll increase vocal practice soon, so get into peak physical shape now.

00:28:14.805 --> 00:28:17.935
- Okay. - No. Don't cry.

00:28:20.275 --> 00:28:23.975
I'm putting everything on the line and going all-in on you.

00:28:24.615 --> 00:28:27.115
It's not just me, but the future of our company...

00:28:27.385 --> 00:28:29.315
is riding on you, Elements.

00:28:29.655 --> 00:28:32.185
So instead of you crying like this,

00:28:32.255 --> 00:28:34.655
show me you're growing every day. Okay?

00:28:35.085 --> 00:28:36.455
- Yes. - Yes.

00:28:38.395 --> 00:28:40.525
I don't want to see you crying. Get out. Go and practice.

00:28:41.465 --> 00:28:42.865
- Okay. - Okay.

00:28:45.665 --> 00:28:48.635
Hey, girls. The CEO is pretty cold, right?

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:50.435
Don't worry about it.

00:28:50.905 --> 00:28:53.875
She just talks like that. Deep down, she was moved too.

00:28:54.045 --> 00:28:56.945
- You're still here? - Hey, she's asking why you're here.

00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:58.515
I'm sorry.

00:28:58.815 --> 00:29:00.715
- Come on, let's go practice! - Okay.

00:29:00.785 --> 00:29:02.385
- Thank you. - Sure.

00:29:02.715 --> 00:29:05.085
- Thank you. - You got this!

00:29:40.825 --> 00:29:45.265
An unstoppable game, no matter what anyone says

00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:46.425
Let's get it on

00:29:47.565 --> 00:29:50.395
Unbreakable passion, fly with me

00:30:05.785 --> 00:30:09.415
It felt like the debut I dreamed of was right around the corner.

00:30:13.425 --> 00:30:16.795
Hey, everyone. Great work at practice today.

00:30:17.155 --> 00:30:18.395
- Thanks! - Wait!

00:30:21.065 --> 00:30:23.165
- What's this? - What is this?

00:30:23.595 --> 00:30:25.195
- I can't believe it! - It's my snack box.

00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:27.035
- Where did you get these? - They look delicious.

00:30:27.365 --> 00:30:28.905
Everyone, just take a little bit...

00:30:29.135 --> 00:30:30.135
Hide it...

00:30:30.935 --> 00:30:32.145
And then...

00:30:32.775 --> 00:30:34.975
Good work, everyone. Ro Mi.

00:30:36.015 --> 00:30:37.475
You should get changed and come out.

00:30:38.945 --> 00:30:43.215
- Okay. - That was the day it happened.

00:30:44.785 --> 00:30:46.855
Yes, everything's all set. We'll be leaving shortly.

00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:49.495
- Yes, just a moment. - Manager Song.

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:52.065
Ro Mi, we're late. Let's hurry.

00:30:52.395 --> 00:30:53.495
Where are we going?

00:30:53.595 --> 00:30:56.995
The recording studio. CEO Kang says you're recording a solo.

00:30:57.395 --> 00:30:59.535
- All of a sudden? Just me? - Yes.

00:30:59.905 --> 00:31:02.805
CEO Kang is waiting for you there, so ask her yourself.

00:31:03.235 --> 00:31:04.235
Okay.

00:31:05.675 --> 00:31:06.675
Get in.

00:31:12.285 --> 00:31:15.184
You're recording when we arrive, so warm up your voice on the way.

00:31:15.185 --> 00:31:16.255
Oh, okay.

00:33:12.465 --> 00:33:15.535
So you're saying you woke up in a strange place?

00:33:15.805 --> 00:33:18.735
You don't even remember how you got there?

00:33:19.575 --> 00:33:20.575
Yes.

00:33:21.745 --> 00:33:22.915
So where was it?

00:33:25.715 --> 00:33:27.715
I really don't know.

00:33:29.915 --> 00:33:31.585
Don't you have anything to say?

00:33:36.995 --> 00:33:38.755
On the way to the studio,

00:33:39.765 --> 00:33:41.895
Ro Mi felt sick and asked to pull over.

00:33:41.965 --> 00:33:43.565
So I let her out and waited.

00:33:43.665 --> 00:33:44.965
But you never came back, so...

00:33:46.465 --> 00:33:49.435
- So I asked to pull over? - You did! Darn it.

00:33:49.805 --> 00:33:50.805
Ro Mi.

00:33:51.335 --> 00:33:55.545
You're not on a crash diet, are you? Using some weird method?

00:33:56.545 --> 00:33:58.015
No, that's not it, CEO Kang.

00:33:58.275 --> 00:34:00.315
But still, how can you not remember anything?

00:34:02.115 --> 00:34:03.285
I also...

00:34:04.915 --> 00:34:05.925
don't know.

00:34:11.895 --> 00:34:13.625
Has anything like this ever happened before?

00:34:14.895 --> 00:34:16.435
Have you ever just passed out like that?

00:34:17.635 --> 00:34:18.635
No.

00:34:20.065 --> 00:34:23.035
How do you even take care of yourself?

00:34:24.635 --> 00:34:25.645
Ro Mi.

00:34:26.475 --> 00:34:27.475
Ro Mi!

00:34:28.745 --> 00:34:30.815
Do you think you're debuting all by yourself?

00:34:33.745 --> 00:34:36.355
CEO Kang, take it easy on her.

00:34:36.615 --> 00:34:38.755
We should just be glad she's back in one piece.

00:34:40.455 --> 00:34:41.655
Get out of my sight.

00:34:42.255 --> 00:34:44.155
- Get out. - Hey.

00:34:45.395 --> 00:34:46.425
Ro Mi, get up.

00:34:49.395 --> 00:34:51.435
Ro Mi, try not to worry too much.

00:34:53.105 --> 00:34:55.835
I'm sorry.

00:34:59.745 --> 00:35:00.775
And then,

00:35:01.605 --> 00:35:03.675
one day, she called me in again.

00:35:03.745 --> 00:35:07.514
Hold it tighter. Ro Mi, you were late. Let's go again.

00:35:07.515 --> 00:35:08.955
Get it together! Let's start from there again.

00:35:11.155 --> 00:35:13.255
Let's go again. Soo Jung, move up a little more.

00:35:13.325 --> 00:35:16.995
Ro Mi, hit the center with more confidence. Ready. Five, six.

00:35:17.155 --> 00:35:20.295
I can fly high. Hit the pose, don't be late.

00:35:20.465 --> 00:35:23.094
Ro Mi, focus here. Where are you looking? Again.

00:35:23.095 --> 00:35:26.365
Excuse me. Have them keep practising the lead-in to the chorus.

00:35:26.435 --> 00:35:28.405
Ro Mi, come with me for a second.

00:35:29.475 --> 00:35:30.505
Ro Mi.

00:35:32.705 --> 00:35:33.745
Yes.

00:35:45.355 --> 00:35:47.154
(Girl Group's Shocking Antics)

00:35:47.155 --> 00:35:48.885
(What is she doing at a bar before her debut?)

00:35:58.035 --> 00:35:59.204
(Girl Group's Shocking Antics)

00:35:59.205 --> 00:36:00.365
(What is she doing at a bar before her debut?)

00:36:00.835 --> 00:36:03.605
They kept it private and sent it only to the General Manager.

00:36:03.905 --> 00:36:06.305
They're threatening to go public once Elements debuts.

00:36:06.805 --> 00:36:09.975
- CEO Kang, I... - I'll be frank with you.

00:36:11.315 --> 00:36:12.415
I can't stop this.

00:36:14.315 --> 00:36:17.055
I honestly don't know anything about this.

00:36:17.115 --> 00:36:20.155
How are we supposed to fix this if you keep saying you don't know?

00:36:21.585 --> 00:36:22.595
Then...

00:36:23.655 --> 00:36:24.755
what am I supposed to do?

00:36:27.295 --> 00:36:28.325
Why are you asking me?

00:36:36.035 --> 00:36:37.035
But...

00:36:46.345 --> 00:36:47.414
(Girl Group's Shocking Antics)

00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:48.445
(What is she doing at a bar before her debut?)

00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:10.005
General Manager.

00:37:11.835 --> 00:37:12.845
Honestly,

00:37:13.645 --> 00:37:15.305
I don't know what to do with this either.

00:37:16.545 --> 00:37:18.944
I considered calling the police,

00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:20.945
but all the blood, sweat, and tears you put in...

00:37:21.015 --> 00:37:23.154
will be wasted.

00:37:23.155 --> 00:37:25.315
Not just for you, but for the other members too.

00:37:25.385 --> 00:37:28.225
And the company will take a huge hit.

00:37:29.025 --> 00:37:32.025
What should I do? Is there really nothing I can do?

00:37:34.495 --> 00:37:35.495
It's not like...

00:37:36.035 --> 00:37:38.365
there's no solution at all.

00:37:39.365 --> 00:37:40.605
What kind of solution is it?

00:37:42.265 --> 00:37:44.335
Those jerks...

00:37:44.675 --> 00:37:46.305
made an offer.

00:37:47.275 --> 00:37:48.275
An offer?

00:37:48.545 --> 00:37:51.975
They'll keep the video from the media. But in exchange...

00:37:52.045 --> 00:37:55.345
Darn it! Those childish scums.

00:37:57.355 --> 00:37:59.225
If you agree to "date" him for a year...

00:38:00.985 --> 00:38:01.985
"Date" him?

00:38:06.625 --> 00:38:07.765
Ro Mi, look at me.

00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:11.935
I'm not speaking as Jeong Gyeong Su, but as your general manager.

00:38:12.435 --> 00:38:14.105
You're the leader of Elements.

00:38:14.465 --> 00:38:17.475
You need to be level-headed about this.

00:38:17.905 --> 00:38:19.675
If you can't debut now, the team is finished.

00:38:20.275 --> 00:38:22.415
As per company policy, you'll owe a cancellation fee.

00:38:22.615 --> 00:38:25.275
Do you want that for everyone, not just you?

00:38:26.515 --> 00:38:27.515
No.

00:38:27.645 --> 00:38:30.684
Right? I don't want that either.

00:38:30.685 --> 00:38:32.555
Let's be real. You, drinking?

00:38:32.655 --> 00:38:34.685
At that hostess bar?

00:38:36.155 --> 00:38:37.155
Gosh.

00:38:41.325 --> 00:38:43.165
There's no need to overthink this.

00:38:45.665 --> 00:38:48.205
Just think about how badly you wanted this.

00:38:49.335 --> 00:38:50.575
Your debut is just around the corner.

00:38:53.345 --> 00:38:54.345
You never know.

00:38:56.215 --> 00:38:57.875
That scum...

00:38:58.415 --> 00:39:00.085
might just become your sponsor for life.

00:39:11.695 --> 00:39:12.695
Think about it.

00:39:14.525 --> 00:39:15.565
Think it over and let me know.

00:39:25.035 --> 00:39:26.105
There was...

00:39:29.345 --> 00:39:30.915
nothing...

00:39:34.515 --> 00:39:36.285
I could do.

00:39:43.895 --> 00:39:46.465
I couldn't even tell the others the truth.

00:39:48.565 --> 00:39:49.965
Just because of me,

00:39:51.635 --> 00:39:53.665
I couldn't ruin everything for them.

00:39:55.135 --> 00:39:56.135
Ro Mi.

00:39:58.235 --> 00:39:59.245
Gosh.

00:40:01.645 --> 00:40:02.675
This must be so hard for you.

00:40:07.385 --> 00:40:08.385
All right.

00:40:09.655 --> 00:40:10.655
You don't have to go.

00:40:13.455 --> 00:40:15.055
As a general manager... No.

00:40:15.155 --> 00:40:18.895
Look, I'm going to talk to you like you're my little sister.

00:40:19.325 --> 00:40:20.925
Just do whatever you want.

00:40:21.525 --> 00:40:24.835
Whether you ask that guy for help...

00:40:25.195 --> 00:40:28.935
or go and tell the other members the truth.

00:40:30.305 --> 00:40:33.275
You'd have to say something like this, I guess.

00:40:34.105 --> 00:40:37.875
"I'm sorry for ruining all your dreams."

00:40:38.315 --> 00:40:42.345
"Our debut is off, and we'll pay the cancellation fee."

00:40:42.985 --> 00:40:46.255
But you'd have to tell them that, right, Ro Mi?

00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:50.895
Yes, I guess it's the right thing. What can you do?

00:40:52.025 --> 00:40:53.125
We're all done for.

00:40:54.995 --> 00:40:57.265
But you can get back on your feet.

00:40:58.335 --> 00:40:59.335
And...

00:41:01.505 --> 00:41:02.505
As for me,

00:41:04.275 --> 00:41:05.275
I'm on your side.

00:41:10.045 --> 00:41:11.175
Think it over carefully.

00:41:13.585 --> 00:41:14.585
I'll be going.

00:41:24.595 --> 00:41:27.095
- That's it! - I don't know!

00:41:27.365 --> 00:41:28.725
This is a total paradise

00:41:29.935 --> 00:41:30.935
This way.

00:41:30.995 --> 00:41:33.735
- It's frustrating. - This isn't my spot.

00:43:04.425 --> 00:43:06.525
Maybe if I just disappeared,

00:43:08.395 --> 00:43:10.495
everything would work out for the best.

00:43:13.035 --> 00:43:15.105
I still don't really understand...

00:43:16.005 --> 00:43:17.435
why I did what I did.

00:43:19.545 --> 00:43:22.045
I just worked as hard as I could.

00:43:22.675 --> 00:43:24.175
That's all I ever did.

00:43:29.555 --> 00:43:31.185
I honestly have no idea...

00:43:34.855 --> 00:43:36.555
what I did wrong.

00:43:43.765 --> 00:43:46.365
The incident from that day that Ro Mi says she can't remember.

00:43:46.565 --> 00:43:49.475
Uncovering the truth about it will be the key.

00:43:50.875 --> 00:43:54.645
- Along with who sent the video. - Right. And who blackmailed her.

00:43:54.745 --> 00:43:57.975
- Exactly. And who filmed it. - You're all saying the same thing.

00:43:58.645 --> 00:44:00.485
Let's just go and grab it all.

00:44:01.045 --> 00:44:02.085
Grab what?

00:44:02.785 --> 00:44:05.555
I think we can just take a box, go there, and pack it all up.

00:44:06.455 --> 00:44:09.825
Packing boxes is my specialty. Leave it to me!

00:44:11.125 --> 00:44:12.895
(Prosecution)

00:44:19.635 --> 00:44:20.835
How may I help you?

00:44:23.905 --> 00:44:25.235
Please take me to the CEO's office.

00:44:31.845 --> 00:44:33.415
What business do you have here?

00:44:33.545 --> 00:44:35.815
Now, don't interfere with an official investigation. Stay put.

00:44:36.715 --> 00:44:39.925
All right, let's pack up everything, down to the last speck of dust!

00:44:40.085 --> 00:44:42.555
(Prosecution)

00:44:42.625 --> 00:44:46.665
This is the short-form video we found on the CEO's computer.

00:44:47.295 --> 00:44:49.165
It's been a while, but it's time for a pop quiz.

00:44:49.635 --> 00:44:51.395
What kind of question could you get from this video?

00:44:51.765 --> 00:44:56.475
How many people in total are in this video?

00:44:56.775 --> 00:44:58.605
Anyone can see it's just Ro Mi in the video,

00:44:58.675 --> 00:45:02.005
but if you're asking, there must be someone else.

00:45:02.275 --> 00:45:05.475
- Four. - Don't just guess wildly.

00:45:07.745 --> 00:45:09.915
- There's one more person. - What?

00:45:10.585 --> 00:45:12.015
Wait, where's another person?

00:45:12.925 --> 00:45:14.785
The ice bucket, on the right side of the table.

00:45:14.855 --> 00:45:18.255
Driver Kim Do Gi, you got it!

00:45:18.625 --> 00:45:20.764
(Girl Group's Shocking Antics)

00:45:20.765 --> 00:45:22.765
(What is she doing at a bar before her debut?)

00:45:23.135 --> 00:45:26.765
The truth about an idol trainee set to debut.

00:45:27.535 --> 00:45:28.535
Gosh.

00:45:30.775 --> 00:45:31.775
I'm sorry.

00:45:32.335 --> 00:45:33.945
But I have to make a living too.

00:45:34.345 --> 00:45:36.915
- That's the general director. - You're right.

00:45:37.415 --> 00:45:40.715
If her own agency is the one blackmailing her,

00:45:42.185 --> 00:45:43.485
is the CEO in on it too?

00:45:43.785 --> 00:45:44.985
She could be.

00:45:45.385 --> 00:45:49.425
But why? After all that training and with her debut so close?

00:45:50.025 --> 00:45:51.195
Then again, maybe not.

00:45:51.555 --> 00:45:53.125
We can't tell what they're thinking.

00:45:56.065 --> 00:45:57.835
Looks like we're going to need someone on the inside.

00:45:59.535 --> 00:46:00.535
Someone on the inside?

00:46:02.605 --> 00:46:03.875
Let's replace her manager.

00:46:04.635 --> 00:46:08.474
That hit-and-run jerk! Wait until I get my hands on him.

00:46:08.475 --> 00:46:11.015
I'll ram him with my car. See how he likes it!

00:46:11.075 --> 00:46:14.045
That jerk won't get away with it. This is so frustrating.

00:46:15.715 --> 00:46:18.215
They suddenly barged in and took everything.

00:46:19.285 --> 00:46:21.485
Then they brought it all back, saying they had the wrong address.

00:46:21.585 --> 00:46:23.695
What? How can the Prosecution be so incompetent?

00:46:24.095 --> 00:46:26.195
That's the Prosecution for you.

00:46:27.065 --> 00:46:28.065
Should we file a complaint?

00:46:29.695 --> 00:46:31.895
Let it go. It'll make things worse for ourselves if we complain.

00:46:32.895 --> 00:46:36.335
- Have you hired a new manager? - No. I mean, there are applicants,

00:46:37.035 --> 00:46:38.735
but no one I can trust.

00:46:39.075 --> 00:46:42.645
Manager Song's post has been open for ages. Hurry up and fill it.

00:46:44.315 --> 00:46:45.315
Sir.

00:46:45.975 --> 00:46:50.815
Let's say I'm driving the kids, and someone blocks our van.

00:46:51.315 --> 00:46:53.825
And you, sir, tell me to go over to the guy who blocked us...

00:46:53.885 --> 00:46:56.555
and punch him.

00:46:56.725 --> 00:47:00.695
I'll do it, no questions asked. You know why?

00:47:02.795 --> 00:47:04.535
Because you're my boss.

00:47:05.065 --> 00:47:09.435
Let's see. A taxi, a tow truck...

00:47:09.835 --> 00:47:11.805
You even worked at a used car dealership.

00:47:12.375 --> 00:47:16.075
Your driving experience is diverse, which is why I called you in.

00:47:17.015 --> 00:47:19.145
But I don't think you're a good fit for us.

00:47:19.245 --> 00:47:21.885
Sir! Right here, right now,

00:47:22.585 --> 00:47:26.055
point to anyone and tell me to go punch them.

00:47:26.555 --> 00:47:29.155
I swear, I'll do it without hesitation.

00:47:29.725 --> 00:47:30.725
Why?

00:47:33.465 --> 00:47:34.925
Because you'd be my boss.

00:47:34.995 --> 00:47:38.895
Why would you suddenly punch people while driving a daycare bus?

00:47:39.135 --> 00:47:41.405
You can't go around punching people. We'd get in huge trouble.

00:47:41.705 --> 00:47:43.475
We'll go out of business. Understand?

00:47:43.975 --> 00:47:45.275
Sorry.

00:47:45.735 --> 00:47:47.075
Sir, wait!

00:47:47.675 --> 00:47:48.675
Sir!

00:47:57.585 --> 00:47:58.585
Excuse me.

00:48:01.385 --> 00:48:03.795
Could I take a look at that resume?

00:48:05.695 --> 00:48:07.425
I happen to be looking for someone to hire myself.

00:48:07.965 --> 00:48:08.965
What?

00:48:17.775 --> 00:48:21.805
Yellowstar, CEO Kang Ju Ri.

00:48:22.645 --> 00:48:23.645
You're the CEO?

00:48:28.545 --> 00:48:30.915
If you were to hire me right now,

00:48:31.255 --> 00:48:35.185
and you pointed to anyone and told me to go punch them...

00:48:35.325 --> 00:48:38.925
Of course, someone as lovely as you would never do that.

00:48:39.325 --> 00:48:43.695
But even so, I'd do it. Why?

00:48:45.195 --> 00:48:46.635
Because you'd be my boss.

00:48:47.165 --> 00:48:48.465
Okay, then. Go punch someone.

00:48:51.735 --> 00:48:53.545
I'm just curious if you'd actually do it.

00:49:10.625 --> 00:49:11.895
I'm going to go to the restroom.

00:49:12.425 --> 00:49:14.025
I'm going to nail it this time.

00:49:17.895 --> 00:49:19.135
Why do you look like that?

00:49:21.965 --> 00:49:23.035
Is he nuts?

00:49:25.275 --> 00:49:28.545
I'm sorry about how I look. I'm sorry.

00:49:29.845 --> 00:49:30.845
Gosh.

00:49:34.785 --> 00:49:36.145
Goodness.

00:49:36.615 --> 00:49:38.685
How could you punch someone for real?

00:49:41.525 --> 00:49:43.155
It was your order, boss.

00:49:48.225 --> 00:49:49.395
I'll do my very best!

00:49:53.905 --> 00:49:55.135
So, can I start today?

00:49:57.535 --> 00:49:58.535
Well...

00:50:06.945 --> 00:50:10.015
CEO Kang Ju Ri. Where can I find her?

00:50:11.085 --> 00:50:12.755
And what is your name, sir?

00:50:14.455 --> 00:50:15.555
I'm the new manager.

00:50:16.795 --> 00:50:18.695
My name is Kim Do Gi.

00:50:19.695 --> 00:50:20.825
Mr. Kim Do Gi?

00:50:22.825 --> 00:50:23.895
Hey.

00:50:27.165 --> 00:50:30.675
I'm Jeong Gyeong Su. The general director.

00:50:31.475 --> 00:50:32.475
Let's drop the formalities.

00:50:34.375 --> 00:50:35.605
Looking sharp.

00:50:36.745 --> 00:50:37.845
I hear you're new to the industry.

00:50:39.115 --> 00:50:43.415
This has the members' schedules and a summary of your basic duties.

00:50:43.685 --> 00:50:45.455
Get up to speed on it as soon as possible.

00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:48.825
I hate being hassled,

00:50:48.885 --> 00:50:51.925
so don't ask questions. Just use your head to figure it out.

00:50:51.995 --> 00:50:54.165
Use your common sense. Got it?

00:50:56.835 --> 00:50:58.265
In that case, we have a huge problem.

00:50:58.965 --> 00:51:01.205
- Why? What do you mean? - I...

00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:04.535
have no common sense.

00:51:07.145 --> 00:51:09.745
Goodness. That CEO...

00:51:10.675 --> 00:51:13.175
I'm busy enough as it is. Darn it.

00:51:16.185 --> 00:51:18.755
You must address her as CEO Kang.

00:51:20.185 --> 00:51:22.555
Whether she's here or not, when you talk about the CEO,

00:51:22.625 --> 00:51:25.525
you must always address her with her proper title.

00:51:25.725 --> 00:51:28.095
CEO Kang and I have known each other since we were kids.

00:51:28.325 --> 00:51:29.625
We grew up together. She was like a sister...

00:51:31.095 --> 00:51:33.165
- We're especially close. - Even so,

00:51:33.865 --> 00:51:36.675
you must use her proper title. That's because...

00:51:39.275 --> 00:51:40.345
she's the boss.

00:51:43.815 --> 00:51:45.075
Man, that CEO...

00:51:45.645 --> 00:51:47.615
Where did she dig this guy up?

00:51:47.885 --> 00:51:50.085
- It's "CEO Kang". - Hey!

00:51:51.055 --> 00:51:53.655
Don't you open your mouth in front of me.

00:51:54.855 --> 00:51:56.025
But answer me when I talk to you!

00:52:32.025 --> 00:52:34.595
Why don't you look at the camera? Are you shy or something?

00:52:36.125 --> 00:52:37.665
What did I say a star was?

00:52:40.035 --> 00:52:42.465
Someone you can't look away from.

00:52:42.735 --> 00:52:45.035
Exactly. You know that. So why hide?

00:52:45.105 --> 00:52:47.045
You need to smile and look at the camera.

00:52:53.745 --> 00:52:54.785
Soo Jung, come here.

00:53:06.055 --> 00:53:07.065
What are you going to do?

00:53:08.625 --> 00:53:10.135
The camera is on you right now.

00:53:14.335 --> 00:53:15.635
Everyone, take a look at Soo Jung's face.

00:53:19.175 --> 00:53:20.945
You think any of you were different?

00:53:21.305 --> 00:53:23.475
You've all been making this face the entire time.

00:53:24.245 --> 00:53:28.115
Dozens of cameras will capture every single expression.

00:53:28.545 --> 00:53:31.385
And dozens of mics will even pick up the sound of your breath.

00:53:31.985 --> 00:53:37.194
With countless flashes, they'll try to expose the feelings you hide.

00:53:37.195 --> 00:53:38.525
Do you really think you can escape any of that?

00:53:40.695 --> 00:53:42.195
Don't try to show your true feelings.

00:53:42.595 --> 00:53:44.335
Who says anyone wants to know how you really feel?

00:53:44.995 --> 00:53:47.465
Practice your expressions all the way back to the dorm.

00:53:47.905 --> 00:53:50.805
Seeing the looks on your faces today makes me lose my appetite.

00:53:51.535 --> 00:53:52.535
Got it?

00:53:53.035 --> 00:53:54.045
- Yes. - Yes.

00:53:54.445 --> 00:53:55.445
Yes.

00:54:02.785 --> 00:54:05.185
For now, Assistant Manager Kim will take over for Manager Song.

00:54:05.555 --> 00:54:07.225
He'll be managing all of you on the road.

00:54:09.685 --> 00:54:10.955
My name is Kim Do Gi.

00:54:12.625 --> 00:54:13.625
And I...

00:54:14.665 --> 00:54:16.935
am going to manage you all the right way.

00:54:18.035 --> 00:54:19.035
So I'm counting on your cooperation.

00:54:21.365 --> 00:54:23.205
- Thank you in advance. - Thank you in advance.

00:54:25.035 --> 00:54:26.675
Pack up the camera and bring it to my office.

00:54:27.045 --> 00:54:28.045
Yes, ma'am.

00:54:30.845 --> 00:54:31.845
CEO Kang?

00:54:33.115 --> 00:54:34.115
I was just wondering...

00:54:34.815 --> 00:54:36.615
if you heard from Ro Mi yet?

00:54:37.855 --> 00:54:38.855
No, nothing.

00:54:39.615 --> 00:54:43.185
I just can't believe Ro Mi would just take off like that.

00:54:44.195 --> 00:54:46.055
Don't you think something might've happened to her?

00:54:48.595 --> 00:54:50.795
You shouldn't be asking other people about that, Ji An.

00:54:52.095 --> 00:54:53.735
Ask her yourself when she gets back.

00:54:55.165 --> 00:54:56.165
Okay.

00:54:56.235 --> 00:54:57.504
You guys are still a team.

00:54:57.505 --> 00:55:00.905
Practice together to cover her spot. Your debut is coming up.

00:55:02.175 --> 00:55:03.175
Yes, ma'am.

00:55:13.115 --> 00:55:16.685
It needs an accent piece, and then we'll focus on the top.

00:55:18.595 --> 00:55:19.595
Assistant Manager Kim.

00:55:20.925 --> 00:55:22.395
Charge this for me at my desk.

00:55:23.295 --> 00:55:24.295
Yes, ma'am.

00:55:25.895 --> 00:55:28.365
Thanks. On second thought, no thanks.

00:55:31.075 --> 00:55:32.735
What's his deal?

00:55:34.145 --> 00:55:35.375
All right, everyone, let's get back to work.

00:55:55.325 --> 00:55:57.435
Okay, I'm in.

00:56:00.505 --> 00:56:03.365
This file is huge. It's going to take a while.

00:56:06.605 --> 00:56:08.345
That's fine. Take your time.

00:56:09.245 --> 00:56:10.415
Who's this for?

00:56:11.145 --> 00:56:12.315
It's for Soo Jung, the youngest member.

00:56:12.715 --> 00:56:15.545
I'm going for a bold look, just like you suggested, ma'am.

00:56:15.685 --> 00:56:19.685
For her makeup, emphasize the eyes, and make sure her lips are nude.

00:56:20.185 --> 00:56:21.185
Hey!

00:56:23.025 --> 00:56:24.025
Hey.

00:56:28.695 --> 00:56:31.965
It's time for the girls to leave. Go start the car.

00:56:32.895 --> 00:56:36.665
No. I'm not done yet. I still need more time.

00:56:36.735 --> 00:56:38.305
Just a little more.

00:56:39.275 --> 00:56:42.845
Not this again. Why just stand there staring into space?

00:56:44.115 --> 00:56:48.645
CEO Kang! This guy is completely ignoring me.

00:56:50.015 --> 00:56:51.015
Assistant Manager Kim.

00:56:52.155 --> 00:56:54.455
Didn't you hear the director tell you to start the car?

00:57:00.665 --> 00:57:01.665
Almost there.

00:57:09.265 --> 00:57:10.275
All done!

00:57:10.905 --> 00:57:12.035
What?

00:57:13.235 --> 00:57:14.245
What was that?

00:57:25.855 --> 00:57:27.985
Why are you bringing this back? It hasn't even finished charging.

00:57:28.255 --> 00:57:29.655
Because I have to go start the car.

00:57:31.195 --> 00:57:32.195
Right.

00:57:35.165 --> 00:57:36.465
This guy...

00:57:36.865 --> 00:57:38.035
Hey.

00:57:38.565 --> 00:57:39.935
Why that little...

00:57:41.265 --> 00:57:44.435
Don't you think he's got a screw loose?

00:57:44.935 --> 00:57:46.945
That guy is a real piece of work.

00:57:49.145 --> 00:57:51.445
Okay, I'm going through the files on the laptop now.

00:57:51.745 --> 00:57:55.415
It's just girl group music videos, performance recordings,

00:57:55.445 --> 00:57:57.015
and concept materials. That's it.

00:57:57.885 --> 00:58:01.325
Why would she bother carrying all this heavy stuff around?

00:58:03.185 --> 00:58:04.295
What else is on there?

00:58:04.555 --> 00:58:07.525
There are some other documents. I'll check them all too.

00:58:15.835 --> 00:58:16.835
Yes, ma'am.

00:58:16.905 --> 00:58:20.875
Earlier, you seemed like the type to get friendly with the girls.

00:58:21.875 --> 00:58:25.045
Yes. Once I decide to take care of someone,

00:58:25.145 --> 00:58:26.945
- I see it through to the end. - Well, don't.

00:58:28.985 --> 00:58:30.485
Open the glove compartment.

00:58:31.015 --> 00:58:32.185
There should be a pen in there.

00:58:45.765 --> 00:58:47.735
Don't tell me that's a bug.

00:58:48.005 --> 00:58:49.035
Yes. It's a bug.

00:58:49.635 --> 00:58:51.605
Keep it on you at all times so I can listen in.

00:58:53.175 --> 00:58:56.305
Remember this. You're management.

00:58:57.515 --> 00:59:02.185
The moment you become their friend, they'll stop respecting you.

00:59:03.315 --> 00:59:05.915
Don't make small talk and don't ever smile at them.

00:59:09.025 --> 00:59:12.095
If you break any of these rules, you're fired. Understood?

00:59:13.725 --> 00:59:14.725
Crystal clear.

00:59:16.895 --> 00:59:20.135
If you tell me to do something, I do it. No questions asked.

00:59:33.075 --> 00:59:35.244
"Don't talk, don't smile"?

00:59:35.245 --> 00:59:37.455
She's telling you to be a jerk.

00:59:37.985 --> 00:59:40.655
Driver Kim, those girls are really going to hate you.

00:59:47.865 --> 00:59:50.665
Wait. Driver Kim, you can't talk to me anymore, can you?

00:59:53.395 --> 00:59:55.205
We're done with practice.

00:59:56.835 --> 00:59:57.875
Thank you.

01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:07.915
I'm starving.

01:00:08.345 --> 01:00:10.554
Do my eyes look smaller to you?

01:00:10.555 --> 01:00:12.755
What do I do? Look again.

01:00:12.885 --> 01:00:14.825
You think I can get by without surgery?

01:00:15.255 --> 01:00:18.255
- Seriously, stop worrying. - Manager, can you turn on the AC?

01:00:18.625 --> 01:00:19.755
The general manager will get mad.

01:00:25.795 --> 01:00:26.935
Where do I sit?

01:00:27.505 --> 01:00:28.535
Are you out of your mind?

01:00:32.975 --> 01:00:34.005
Gosh.

01:00:36.305 --> 01:00:39.415
My gosh! It's so hot!

01:00:39.975 --> 01:00:41.815
You were supposed to have the AC on!

01:00:42.415 --> 01:00:43.585
Starting the engine.

01:00:45.855 --> 01:00:47.485
I can't believe they're making me train him.

01:00:47.925 --> 01:00:50.455
Today, I'm just showing you the ropes, so pay close attention.

01:00:50.555 --> 01:00:51.755
Turning on the AC.

01:00:57.665 --> 01:00:58.665
Departing now.

01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:15.845
Okay.

01:01:17.855 --> 01:01:20.115
What am I going to do? I feel like I'll never get this dance down.

01:01:20.355 --> 01:01:23.925
Hey, stop worrying already. You're making me even hungrier.

01:01:23.995 --> 01:01:26.895
- Wait, you can't get this part? - You all did great today.

01:01:27.325 --> 01:01:29.925
I'll have some food sent down, so you can all get some rest.

01:01:29.995 --> 01:01:31.894
- Thank you! - Thank you!

01:01:31.895 --> 01:01:32.895
Thank you!

01:01:32.896 --> 01:01:34.865
Thanks for the ride! I call the first shower!

01:01:34.935 --> 01:01:35.935
No way!

01:01:36.565 --> 01:01:37.975
Assistant Manager Kim, you're with me.

01:01:40.505 --> 01:01:41.575
Excuse me.

01:01:41.975 --> 01:01:44.775
Give us the most nutritious and delicious thing you have.

01:01:44.845 --> 01:01:48.545
Ma'am! Just one roll of the basic kimbap.

01:01:48.615 --> 01:01:51.115
You got it. I'll have that right out for you.

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:56.354
There are 4 of them, so they need 4 rolls, at least.

01:01:56.355 --> 01:01:57.355
Hey.

01:01:58.255 --> 01:01:59.955
Shut it. Sit down.

01:02:04.165 --> 01:02:07.465
I told you I'm only going over this with you once.

01:02:07.765 --> 01:02:08.805
Listen up.

01:02:11.435 --> 01:02:14.545
Hey, wait. How come you never answer my questions?

01:02:15.005 --> 01:02:16.075
Because I'm listening.

01:02:20.315 --> 01:02:24.155
Tomorrow morning, get them one roll of basic kimbap.

01:02:25.115 --> 01:02:26.115
Also,

01:02:26.915 --> 01:02:30.555
keep nagging them to watch their weight.

01:02:32.495 --> 01:02:33.495
Got it?

01:02:34.495 --> 01:02:37.195
"Yes." Darn it. And the most important part is this.

01:02:38.595 --> 01:02:39.995
This wench right here.

01:02:40.735 --> 01:02:42.835
If she shows up, report it to me immediately.

01:02:43.235 --> 01:02:45.205
And don't let her get anywhere near the other members.

01:02:48.105 --> 01:02:49.805
Why is that?

01:02:50.075 --> 01:02:52.675
Just do as you're told!

01:02:57.715 --> 01:02:58.755
Got it?

01:03:01.525 --> 01:03:03.124
"Yes!"

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:05.925
This jerk. He won't answer any of my questions.

01:03:06.025 --> 01:03:08.495
I'm leaving. Grab the darn food and go!

01:03:08.565 --> 01:03:09.895
(Snack Food Feast)

01:03:22.045 --> 01:03:23.775
All set. You can talk now.

01:03:25.215 --> 01:03:27.145
On Kang Ju Ri's personal laptop, I found some documents,

01:03:27.945 --> 01:03:30.045
including the exclusive contracts for Element.

01:03:30.115 --> 01:03:32.885
Each of them is racking up 40,000 dollars in debt every month.

01:03:33.615 --> 01:03:37.055
- Repayment starts after they debut. - Debt?

01:03:37.085 --> 01:03:39.395
Most of it is supposedly for their current training expenses.

01:03:39.795 --> 01:03:43.465
It includes a "mental coaching" fee from CEO Kang Ju Ri...

01:03:44.895 --> 01:03:45.935
for 3,000 dollars per session.

01:03:46.535 --> 01:03:47.805
Mental coaching?

01:03:48.105 --> 01:03:49.135
You all saw what that was.

01:03:49.535 --> 01:03:51.575
Her screaming at them and hitting them.

01:03:51.735 --> 01:03:54.405
Wait, she gets paid 3,000 dollars for doing that?

01:03:55.205 --> 01:04:00.145
She's definitely hard on them, but I thought she really cared.

01:04:00.375 --> 01:04:01.384
What?

01:04:01.385 --> 01:04:03.015
But there's something else that's odd.

01:04:04.785 --> 01:04:05.785
What's that?

01:04:06.355 --> 01:04:07.755
They're not looking for Ro Mi.

01:04:08.085 --> 01:04:09.625
In fact, they're actively keeping her away.

01:04:09.825 --> 01:04:10.855
And the most important part is this.

01:04:11.655 --> 01:04:13.825
If she shows up, report it to me immediately.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.065
And don't let her get anywhere near the other members.

01:04:17.735 --> 01:04:20.665
Did you find the location where Ro Mi was in that photo?

01:04:20.905 --> 01:04:23.765
Of course. It was very hard.

01:04:23.835 --> 01:04:24.935
It was easy, though.

01:04:25.305 --> 01:04:26.905
We just tailed the general director, and he led us right to it.

01:04:27.205 --> 01:04:28.205
It was easy.

01:04:38.415 --> 01:04:39.685
Let's head there right away.

01:05:06.845 --> 01:05:08.285
Is someone else here?

01:05:08.745 --> 01:05:10.955
No, the manager said they were closed today.

01:05:12.515 --> 01:05:13.785
Hang on, I'll go check.

01:05:16.755 --> 01:05:18.525
I think they're onto us. You need to hide now!

01:05:25.395 --> 01:05:26.795
Someone must be here.

01:05:38.475 --> 01:05:39.475
Who's there?

01:06:50.485 --> 01:06:51.485
