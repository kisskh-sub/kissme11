[Episode 19]

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.350
Look, that's Macau waters ahead.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.690
What's that?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.960
It's a boat!

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.310
Hurry! Cut the engine!

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.970
Zixia!

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.190
Shut the engine down.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.670
Fire the flare!

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.320
Come on, get down.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.829
Pals,

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.530
let's start the boat.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.590
Oh, no.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.610
Wanqi is planning to draw them away.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.460
Over there!

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.670
Over there! Row that way!

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.340
Fire at them!

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.860
Comrades,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.620
get ready for battle!

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.280
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.750
Major Yamaguchi.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.900
I was ordered to arrest Qiao Yinwan.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.760
Why did you
bring me to the Government House?

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.560
Actually, Qiao Yinwan is right here now.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.780
How is that possible?

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.030
We've been following her.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.960
Just this evening,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.330
she was picked up by a car
flying the Portuguese flag

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.790
and taken directly
to the Government House.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.760
Sir,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.180
that woman is coming out.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.880
About the results of our meeting,
I will report

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.519
in detail
to Governor De Solaire when I return.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.160
I will surely spare no effort
to make the cooperation happen.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.649
Thank you for your help, Mr. Lok Pak.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.000
Freeze!

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.100
Major Yamaguchi?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.340
Your Excellency the Governor.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.010
What are you doing?

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.070
Your Excellency the Governor,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.540
I am Deputy Chief Yamaguchi Hisami

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.790
of the Intelligence Agency
from the Imperial Army stationed in Macau.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.380
By order of General Yazaki,

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:43.990
I'm here to arrest this woman.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.990
Arrest Miss Qiao?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.970
On what grounds?

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.960
What on earth is this about?

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.750
Your Excellency the Governor,
here's the thing.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.240
Recently,
the underground anti-Japanese forces

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.530
stole a batch

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.800
of important strategic materials
in Hong Kong.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.400
Based on our investigation,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.830
this woman, Qiao Yinwan, is

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.200
a key participant in this theft.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.170
Therefore, I'm here to arrest her.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.410
Governor Isoya,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.680
I, on behalf of the Macau government,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.710
came in good faith to discuss with you

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.510
about the implementation
of military currency in Macau.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.050
Even though we haven't
reached a conclusion yet,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.710
there's no need to use my fiancée
to threaten me.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.960
If this is the case,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.280
our cooperation will just end here.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.420
Mr. Lok Pak,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.110
there's been a misunderstanding.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.530
I knew nothing about this beforehand.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.320
I doubt that.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.080
How else could there be
such a coincidence?

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.610
I brought my fiancée
to the Government House,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.420
and your men were waiting
at the door to arrest her.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.680
If this isn't a threat,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.960
then what is it?

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.850
You just said Miss Qiao committed a crime.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.140
Is there any evidence?

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.630
Well, we're still verifying that.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.920
And that theft you mentioned,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.130
when did it take place?

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.660
About an hour and a half ago.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.130
Nonsense!

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.830
Miss Qiao has been attending

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.670
a special welcome dinner party
that I hosted

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.880
for Mr. Lok Pak.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.320
I am the witness.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.740
How could she possibly have time
to be involved in any theft?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.080
You're right.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.060
Mr. Lok Pak
represents the Macau government

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.620
and was invited to discuss
the military currency cooperation plan.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.620
He is an honored guest of the Empire.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.690
Even I wouldn't dare to neglect him.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.480
You bunch of bastards,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.330
how dare you slander his fiancée

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.210
and sabotage
the Empire's major cooperation plan?

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.100
Such audacity!

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.540
Sorry.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.770
Apologize to Mr. Lok Pak
and Miss Qiao now!

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.620
We're sorry. Please forgive us.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.940
Regarding this matter,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.670
I will
severely hold Yazaki Kanju accountable

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.100
and demand an explanation from him.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.540
Get lost now.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.250
Yes.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.130
Mr. Lok Pak,

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.510
Miss Qiao,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.250
I sincerely apologize
for this misunderstanding.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.620
Please forgive us.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.100
I promise

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.240
that this will absolutely
never happen again.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.040
I also hope that you, Mr. Lok Pak,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.310
won't let this affect your mood

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.450
or our cooperation plans.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.420
Since you, Your Excellency the Governor,
really didn't know about this,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.060
then...

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.690
Then we'll just

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.100
let it go.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.360
Please.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.159
Let's go.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.570
Thank you.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.310
My pleasure.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.200
When He Xian approached me,

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.270
I really had no idea

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.290
that you were involved
in such a risky plan.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.760
I was even more surprised

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.770
that you had the audacity

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.710
to risk your life
dealing with the Japanese.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.390
Compared to my brother,

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.120
I've done very little.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.950
Thankfully, it turned out well in the end.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.440
Also, I once thought

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.950
that He Xian was

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:41.289
misleading you

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:42.870
and hurting you.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.070
But now it seems

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.350
that he really does

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.660
care about you as a friend

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.150
and isn't so cold-hearted after all.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.190
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
gone to such lengths

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.330
to come up with this plan,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.590
having me protect you.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.110
What's wrong?

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.230
I'm wondering
how Xian and the others are doing.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:19.810
Chief,

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.560
it's not that our men
didn't give it their all.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.780
The guerrillas suddenly attacked

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.850
with a dozen boats

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.940
and hundreds of men.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.540
Our men couldn't hold out,
so we had to retreat.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.490
I'm telling the truth.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.330
If I'm lying,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.380
may I be struck down by lightning.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:37.880
Otherwise,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.190
I...

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.850
I wouldn't have lost so many of my men.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.750
Were the printing plates

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.370
on the boat you sank

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.040
or the one that got away?

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.580
The boat that escaped was

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.020
apparently slower than the others.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.250
It should be...

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:15.400
Wait.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.710
You just said the firefight at sea

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.470
happened less than an hour ago.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.270
That's right.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.850
If those printing plates were
really on that boat,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.400
they must be hiding the goods

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.750
somewhere in Macau now.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.180
But Macau is so big,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.330
and we don't know who did it.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.850
It's really hard to track them down.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.080
What about He Xian from Tai Fung Bank?

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.120
Any movements from him these days?

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.210
He Xian?

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.110
Chief,

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.350
why are you asking about He Xian now...

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.210
Answer me.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.930
Tai Fung Bank

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.380
put up a notice 2 days ago,

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.090
saying they'd be
doing inventory for 3 days.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.280
He Xian must be inside the bank.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.110
"Must be"?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.310
Have your men

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.060
actually seen him in person?

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.560
Well,

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.780
actually not.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.670
However,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.440
the bank has a regulation

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.070
that during inventory, the General Manager
and other managers must be present.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.850
No one else is allowed to enter.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.280
He Xian is the manager there,

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.800
so he must be inside the bank.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.490
Plus, my men have confirmed

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.220
that his wife delivers food
to the bank every day.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.680
This information is definitely correct.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.520
Let's go.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.300
Master Sanhe, I've got to go.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.190
Okay. Zixia,

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.340
escort Xian home.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.350
You in the back, place it properly.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.410
The intelligent agents are at your door.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.740
What should we do, Xian?

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.990
Go straight and keep driving.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:11:59.830
Okay.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.520
Coming!

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:03.570
Who is it?

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.720
It's you.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.180
What's the matter,

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.580
barging into someone's home late at night?

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.240
Who are you?

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.060
How dare you break

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.640
into a private residence
in the dead of night?

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.950
Who is that man?

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.040
This is Colonel Sawa,

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.370
the Agency Chief from the Imperial Army
stationed in Macau.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.690
It's already 2 AM.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.850
How weird.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.510
Mr. He isn't

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.020
even home.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.180
What are you going to do?

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.240
What are you doing?

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.090
I told you Xian is resting.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.400
This is so rude of you.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.300
You can't do this!

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.820
Agency Chief Sawa?

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.260
Captain Huang?

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.390
Who is there?

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:09.700
Xian?

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:10.800
Be careful.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.040
What's happening?

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.610
It's the intelligent agent.
Go open the door.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.180
I...

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.100
Hurry!

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:18.780
Okay.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.450
Who is it? Coming!

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:24.830
It's you.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.450
I told you Xian is resting.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.940
This is so rude of you.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.810
You can't do this!

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.980
Agency Chief Sawa?

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.240
Captain Huang?

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:42.190
Xian,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.260
you seem to have had
quite a few drinks tonight.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.140
It's my son's birthday,
and I was too happy.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.800
So I had a couple extra drinks.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.940
I had a bit too much,

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.600
so I just went upstairs to bed.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.020
What's going on?

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.210
Chief Sawa, Captain Huang,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.400
what brings you here at my home so late?

00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.540
Mr. He,

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.300
have you been home all night?

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:03.710
Daddy.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.460
Of course.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.710
Little girl,

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.320
you're so cute.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.520
Little boy,

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.540
it's your birthday today, right?

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.490
Mm.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.820
Your daddy was busy today

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.570
and couldn't stay home for your birthday.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.860
Are you upset?

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.810
Daddy has been home the whole time

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.540
and celebrated my birthday with me.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.780
Why would I be upset?

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.730
Little girl.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.560
Today,

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.010
was your brother's birthday cake

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.140
delicious?

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.460
Yes.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.820
Yes?

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.730
So how many pieces did you have?

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.450
Two.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.540
Two pieces?

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.660
It must be really tasty.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.420
I'd like to try some too.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:20.680
So,

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.090
besides you and your brother,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.190
who else

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.540
had some

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.970
of that delicious birthday cake?

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.250
Mommy and Grandpa had some, too.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:35.330
Mommy and Grandpa?

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:41.810
Why didn't your daddy

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.260
have any?

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.160
Let me guess.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.920
Because

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.260
he wasn't home,

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.210
right?

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.180
No,

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.090
it was because the piece for Daddy

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.590
had flowers on it.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:11.950
I liked them,

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.680
so Daddy gave his piece to me

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.280
and didn't have any himself.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:19.530
Chief Sawa,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:20.810
Captain Huang,

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.330
I'll ask you again.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.800
Why have you come to my home
in the middle of the night?

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.190
What exactly is this about?

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.420
Xian, calm down.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.810
We're just here investigating a case.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.010
You're investigating a case at my home?

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.210
Captain Huang,
if you don't explain clearly,

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.080
I'll call the police.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:48.640
Mr. He,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.260
why don't you pick it up?

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.710
May I help you?

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:57.440
Hello?

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.570
Xian, it's me.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:00.560
Dr. Ke?

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.190
What is it?

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:04.880
Wanqi is here with me.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.410
Come over as soon as you can.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:17.329
Mr. He, I have a car.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.609
How about I drive you to the clinic?

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.829
Don't bother.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.270
It's nothing.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.599
It's not easy to get a taxi at night.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.400
Besides,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.620
because of the misunderstanding just now,

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.930
I've caused trouble for your family.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.180
Consider this

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.050
my apology.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.200
What's wrong?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.680
Mr. He, are you afraid to accept a ride?

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.840
Is there

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.190
anything inconvenient on Mr. Ma's side?

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.550
Since you insist,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.490
I won't stand on ceremony.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:56.550
Please.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.790
Dr. Ke!

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:10.950
Yes?

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.580
Xian.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.950
I rushed over as soon as I got the call.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.970
Chief Sawa and Captain Huang
happened to come to my house

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.970
and insisted on giving me a ride here.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.830
Where is Wanqi?

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:23.790
Inside.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.880
Wanqi?

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.120
Wanqi!

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.250
Ms Ming,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.400
Wanqi was perfectly fine
when he and I were

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.710
doing inventory at Tai Fung Bank today.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.710
How did he suddenly end up like this?

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.880
It's all my fault.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.100
I noticed Mr. Ma had been busy lately,

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.790
so I made him some late-night snack.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:46.970
But while he was drinking the soup,

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.860
he accidentally choked on it.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:49.180
What?

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:49.840
Look.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.970
Choked on soup

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.770
and passed out, coughing blood?

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.160
Hey, Dr. Ke,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.580
do you think

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:00.580
this is possible?

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.290
Of course not.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.030
So you're saying

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.450
that Mr. Ma ended up like this

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.510
for some other reason?

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.010
That's right.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.420
I initially heard it was because he
choked on soup and coughed up blood.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.420
I also thought that was impossible.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:18.750
But Mr. Ma

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.660
has been coughing severely lately.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.620
So I gave him

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.080
a chest examination

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.710
and found out the truth.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.320
What truth?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.750
Mr. Ma

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.940
has tuberculosis in his lungs.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.590
It's already quite serious.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.070
The choking was just a trigger
for the bleeding.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.740
Tuberculosis is the real cause.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.550
That's a terminal illness!

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.450
Hold on.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.490
Dr. Ke,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.120
are you

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:55.940
sure of it?

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.790
Captain Huang,

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.920
send someone immediately

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.970
to the consulate

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.640
to bring Dr. Tanaka over here.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.170
Yes, sir.

[Nanhua Medical Club]

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:35.620
Chief,

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.250
why do you think that the incident
about the printing plates was

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.160
their doing?

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.390
It couldn't be anyone else.

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.320
We've been to He Xian's home

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.950
and confirmed that he was
celebrating his son's birthday.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.880
He couldn't have been in Hong Kong.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.640
I think Ma Wanqi seems rather suspicious.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.140
How could he possibly drink some soup

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.110
and end up with tuberculosis?

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.930
I saw someone jump off the boat
during the explosion.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.290
I believe it might have been Ma Wanqi.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.420
Once the test results are out,

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.470
the truth will come to light.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.930
It's still not over yet?

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.790
Dr. Tanaka,

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.140
are the results still not out yet?

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.030
Dr. Ke's diagnosis was correct.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.180
He does have tuberculosis.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.420
What?

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.210
Even if it is tuberculosis,

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.680
would choking on soup
cause him to cough up blood

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.380
or even pass out?

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.680
I can only say
it's not entirely impossible.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.130
Colonel Sawa,
do you have any other questions?

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.110
No, no.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.990
Mr. Ma is so young,

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.660
yet suffering from a terminal illness.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.040
What a pity.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.530
We won't disturb his rest.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.520
We'll take our leave.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.030
From today on,

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.890
monitor He Xian around the clock.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.510
I want to know

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.050
his every move.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.680
[The Healing Arts Endure]

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.620
Dr. Ke,

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.450
you're really amazing.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.490
Not only can you treat illnesses,

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.220
but you can also fake symptoms.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.660
Even that Japanese doctor was

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.870
fooled by you.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.880
What trick did you use?

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.140
What's wrong?

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.080
I don't have any special tricks
up my sleeve.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.580
Wanqi...

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.230
He really has severe tuberculosis.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.240
I've seen TB patients before!

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.340
Lifeless eyes,

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:10.950
weak speech,

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.190
sickly all over.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.910
Wanqi is energetic every day,

busy from morning till night,

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.260
never missing work.

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.210
He just coughs a bit more than usual.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.740
How could he have
such serious tuberculosis?

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.530
I was negligent.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:25.920
Like you,

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.450
I was also fooled

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.310
by Wanqi's tireless appearance.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.700
I'm a doctor,

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.990
and I heard his severe coughing,

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:37.990
but...

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:38.690
But...

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.290
But apart from reminding him
to get checked,

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.900
I just didn't take it seriously.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.290
Until just now,

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.050
when Captain Ou saved him
and brought him to the clinic,

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.110
I finally realized

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.010
how seriously ill he is.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.100
As a doctor and a friend,

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.420
I've truly failed in my duty.

Dear all citizens,

Stop drinking.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:32.590
I came today

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.260
because Xian
asked me to bring you something.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.710
These are the first issued Macau patacas.

that were it not for Mary,

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.780
About what happened last time,

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.490
I've been wanting to apologize

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.710
to you and Mr. Qiao

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.880
properly.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.950
Don't bother.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.500
If you still can't forgive me,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:30.920
I understand.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.390
You don't need to apologize

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.280
to my brother or to me.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:46.340
Actually,

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.080
I've been the one
struggling to understand.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.290
What I truly couldn't get over wasn't

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.030
that you lied to me,

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.520
but that my brother lied.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:00.820
Your brother?

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:02.510
Yes.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.030
When I found out

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.570
that my brother was assisting you
with your plan,

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.350
and he was even willing

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.540
to sacrifice himself for this plan,

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.040
that was what I found hard to accept.

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.050
I used

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.290
to take my anger out on you

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.520
and refuse to see you.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.450
But actually,

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:32.520
I just didn't want to accept the truth.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.210
That day...

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.190
When I saw my brother that day,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.660
I suddenly understood.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.120
My brother wasn't the cowardly person

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:02.450
I thought he was.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.320
I've been worried

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.860
that you couldn't handle the shock.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.500
But surprisingly,

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.690
after experiencing Mr. Qiao's sacrifice,

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.680
you could still be so brave,

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.420
so composed,

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:17.790
and so sober.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.920
Because I carry

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.460
the responsibility
my brother entrusted to me.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.660
Maybe it's also because

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.960
my brother has always been the one

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.900
who valued me the most,

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.360
who trusted me the most,

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:35.950
and who

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.680
had the highest expectations for me.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:42.590
Compared to our sibling bond

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.740
that I've cherished,

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.530
my brother turned

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.690
personal feelings into great love.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.680
Only great love

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.870
can achieve great righteousness.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.160
Mr. Qiao

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.490
truly deserves our admiration.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.520
Actually, it's not just my brother.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.090
You're the same.

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.770
Me?

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.360
In the past,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.190
I didn't fully get this

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.620
and even misunderstood you.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.760
But now, things are completely different.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:30.880
Xian,

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.900
for everything you've done

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.510
in the past and present,

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.840
I only feel proud of you.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.120
What's wrong?

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:01.900
Nothing.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.510
Let's go this way.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:21.550
What's happening?

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.260
Where did they go?

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.290
Qiuzai, we lost them.

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:28.940
What now?

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.100
Hurry and tell Mr. Huang!

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.190
They were coming after you?

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.550
Yinwan, go back to school first.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:46.400
Go this way.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.510
What about you?

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.440
I'll be fine. Just go back first.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.810
Mr. Huang, we lost them.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:04.750
What? You lost them?

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.440
You guys have 3 pairs of eyes
and 6 legs in total,

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.710
and you even failed
to track down 1 person?

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.100
What are you even good at?

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.360
Go find them right now!

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:13.190
Otherwise,

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.580
you'll have to report to Chief Sawa
and take the punishment yourselves.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.440
Did you hear me?

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.120
There's no need, Captain Huang.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.970
X-Xian.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.100
Captain Huang, if you want to tail me,

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.160
why bother going to all this trouble?

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.640
I've come to you myself.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.800
Ask me anything you want.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.750
X-Xian, you've got me wrong.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.920
I was discussing something else with them.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.330
How could I possibly arrange for someone
to monitor you?

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:41.990
Really not?

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:43.190
Really not. Trust me.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.380
That's good then.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.250
I'm relieved to hear that.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.600
After all, I'm a businessman.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.860
If I always have
the Special Operations Team following me,

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.460
what will others think of me?

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.720
Those who know

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.940
might think Captain Huang
cares about his friend,

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.710
providing me with free bodyguards.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.040
But those who don't know

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.230
might think that Agency Chief Sawa is

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.920
treating me as an anti-Japanese rebel,

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.710
ready to take action against me
at any moment.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:07.080
How can I continue
doing business normally in this case?

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:07.510
Xian,

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.470
you're overthinking this.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:09.010
That's not true.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:09.940
Absolutely not.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.190
You know very well
whether it's true or not, Captain Huang.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.400
I just want to say

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.250
I don't want to see them anymore.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:18.320
Otherwise,

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.600
I might as well consider myself
an anti-Japanese rebel

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.130
and turn myself in to Agency Chief Sawa.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.450
If it comes to that point,

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.990
I promise that I'll say anything I know

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.290
and not hide any secrets.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.690
Like all the things that you,
Captain Huang, have confessed to and done

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.100
and all the documents you've signed
and left behind,

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:35.840
I will hand over them all

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.040
to the Imperial Army.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.690
Then there would be
no need for surveillance.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:41.400
How about that, Captain Huang?

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.120
X-Xian, you must be joking.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.320
I promise

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.920
that things like what happened today

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.970
will absolutely never happen again.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:48.530
For real?

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.060
For real.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.770
If anyone dares
to disturb your peace again,

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:57.360
I, Huang Gongjie,
will be the first to teach them a lesson.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:32:59.940
Good.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.950
My wife and children are waiting
for me for dinner.

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.950
I'll be going now.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.120
Take care.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.510
Now he's starting to threaten me.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.080
Mr. Huang,

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.350
why do you have to swallow your pride
in front of him?

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.160
I think we should just go all the way
and have him...

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.320
You think we can finish him that easily?

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.140
He has leverage over us.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.010
Besides, things are different now.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.140
He's now

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.370
the Acting General Manager
of Tai Fung Bank

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.920
and the so-called Chinese Business Manager

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.720
of Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.290
We really can't do anything to him.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.250
So what do we do next?

00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.850
Continue the surveillance?

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.300
The Chief has ordered us

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.290
to report his movements every day.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.270
But...

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.420
But what?

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:08.840
Huh?

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.130
If you dare let him discover you again,

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.130
I won't spare you!

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.360
Qiuzai,

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:31.050
we need to monitor He Xian

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:32.650
while not letting him find out.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.949
What should we do?

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.380
Why are you asking me?

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.780
I have no idea, either!

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.400
Bottom line is

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.780
that Chief Sawa
must receive daily reports.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.550
He Xian must not be alarmed.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.900
Figure out the rest ourselves!

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.130
I'll help you manage Tai Fung Bank for now

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.760
and hand it back when you recover.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.670
Mr. Lin is handling things in Hengfengyu,

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.590
so there's no problem.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.090
Okay.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.720
Wanqi,

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.790
just focus on getting better.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.820
Leave all business matters to Xian.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.130
Thank you for your help, Xian.

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:17.790
No worries.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.840
You could give this soup to me.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.170
I'll have the staff in the kitchen
keep it warm.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.130
Xian, Mrs. He,

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.130
so you're here, too.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:27.670
Yes.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.170
Wanqi,

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.070
I made this lung-nourishing soup
following Mrs. He's recipe.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.220
Drink it while it's warm.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.200
Didn't Ms Ming tell you

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.400
that I'm in a meeting?

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.350
Please leave.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.070
Xian and his wife aren't outsiders.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.440
We're in the middle of something.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:50.900
Get out.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.970
Wanqi.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:56.470
Leave.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.760
Take care, Mr. He, Mrs. He.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:18.820
Qiwen,

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.240
Wanqi usually

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.400
goes along with Baixin.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.080
What was that just now?

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.290
Can't you tell?

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.010
When Baixin came
to learn soup-making from me,

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:33.070
she talked about Wanqi's condition.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.820
I just realized today

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:38.380
that Wanqi hasn't told her
he has tuberculosis.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.790
Why?

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.710
Tuberculosis is incurable.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.120
What other reason could there be?

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.570
He doesn't want to be a burden to Baixin

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.900
and would rather play the bad guy himself.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.650
Now that I think about it,

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:54.820
I was helping Wanqi

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.100
pick an engagement ring a few days ago.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.170
[Kiang Wu Elementary School]

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:51.820
Mr. Liang,

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.030
don't overwork yourself lately.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.560
Remember to take more rest.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:55.820
Alright.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.360
Mr. Liang,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.700
I understand

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.360
that you're under great pressure
with the recent prices.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.470
But in Zhongshan,

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.400
the enemy is implementing
extremely strict inspections.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.130
And in Macau,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.780
Japanese businesses are
snapping everything up regardless of cost,

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.590
driving prices through the roof.

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.990
At current prices,

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.650
it's already very difficult
to purchase goods.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:18.130
I understand.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.970
The entire rear area is

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.960
almost entirely dependent
on this year's new airlift, the Hump,

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.130
to maintain

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.110
our pitiful amount of imports.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.050
But how much can the air force
actually transport?

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.090
Not to mention that they have to fly
over the Himalayas.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:35.740
You know what?

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.920
Dozens of aircraft crash every month.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.510
The Nationalist Government
has no choice now

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.240
but to use Customs Gold Units

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.490
as an emergency measure.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.300
But our limited gold reserves

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.770
won't last long.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:52.070
The mainland's local specialties can't be
transported out to exchange for money,

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.840
so we must find other ways to raise funds.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.950
You mean...

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.450
A task has come down from Chongqing.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.490
They want the Macau party branch to assist

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.420
in using Macau's financial market

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.050
to urgently issue a batch

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.720
of wartime government bonds globally

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.320
to address the pressing needs
of the rear area.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.990
Issuing government bonds isn't

00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:17.300
something ordinary financial institutions

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.490
can handle.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:20.590
I'm afraid we have to mobilize

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.900
the entire financial sector in Macau

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.150
to collectively underwrite

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.150
for this to work.

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.200
The Chinese merchants are
easy to convince.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.570
Tai Fung Bank can take the lead

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.440
to organize all banks of Chinese merchants

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.840
to underwrite the bonds.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.170
The key is Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:35.800
In terms of scale and reputation,

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.200
it's still No.1 in Macau.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760
Moreover,

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.880
only BNU can handle overseas issuance.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:43.380
Therefore,

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.070
we must get them involved.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.090
I'll figure out a way to handle this.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:50.970
Good.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.250
Thank you for your efforts then.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.760
Our Macau branch

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.150
will definitely increase
promotional efforts

00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:59.080
to support government bond sales.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.800
Let's do it this way.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.760
That's

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.360
my detailed plan
for government bond underwriting.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.260
Overall,

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.780
the Chinese government's

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.780
extensive promotion
of these wartime government bonds is

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:11.940
evident to all.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.090
With reasonable underwriting commissions,

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.340
if Banco Nacional Ultramarino
can participate in it,

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.010
we will also obtain

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.650
exclusive overseas underwriting rights,

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.110
making this a secure
and profitable business.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.370
Whether it's feasible

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.780
depends on the directors' approval.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.170
In my opinion, Manager He's proposal is

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.200
detailed and specific.

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.030
I don't see any problems.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:37.340
Moreover, all major Chinese banks in Macau

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.530
have actively

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.530
participated
in this government bond underwriting.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.400
If BNU stays out of this,

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.340
it wouldn't match its position

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.530
as Macau's No.1 bank.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.270
This won't do, no matter what.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.570
Therefore,

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.090
I'm in favor of Banco Nacional Ultramarino

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.420
participating
in this government bond underwriting plan.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.360
This matter

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.740
requires more caution, I'm afraid.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.530
What?

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.130
Are there any problems
with the underwriting plan?

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.130
Manager He,

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:09.090
your plan is fine.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:09.940
However,

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.900
I want to remind everyone

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.220
that if a bank publicly underwrites
Chinese government bonds,

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.920
will the Japanese allow it?

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.940
What will they do?

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.070
So what if the Japanese don't allow it?

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:25.240
The bonds our bank is
issuing this time are

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.650
both reasonable and legal.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:29.800
Does BNU need to ask

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.630
the Japanese for permission
to conduct normal business?

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.150
Indeed, that's logical.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.720
But this is still issuing bonds
for the Chinese government.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.940
If we Portuguese
get too involved in Chinese affairs,

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.740
as domineering as the Japanese are,

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.940
we might bring trouble upon ourselves.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.450
Mr. Antonio,

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:49.030
Mr. Aveiro,

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.610
so regarding Chinese affairs,

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.320
the Portuguese had better not interfere,

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.420
or help,

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.980
or participate in them.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:57.930
Is that what you two mean?

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.180
Very well then.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:05.260
I'd like to ask all directors present

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.460
to recall something.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.010
Since the Pacific War broke out,

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.760
the Japanese have repeatedly
caused trouble for no reason,

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.900
pushing Macau to the brink several times.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.850
How did Macau survive these crises?

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.920
Was it solely through Portuguese efforts,

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.320
or through Sino-Portuguese cooperation?

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.840
Or more often, it was the Chinese people's
relentless fighting at the front

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.040
that turned the tide.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.320
You're always
thinking about not offending the Japanese

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.750
to avoid trouble.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.420
But looking at those past events,

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.480
when did Macau ever provoke trouble?

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.110
It was always the Japanese
stirring up trouble for no reason

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.800
and trying to destroy Macau!

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.700
Do you want to avoid disaster

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.050
by pleasing the Japanese?

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.630
Given the way they are,
is that even possible?

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.420
Macau

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.650
does not belong to the Portuguese.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:51.440
You want Portuguese and Chinese

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.110
to stay out of each other's affairs.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.150
But as the Chinese proverb goes,

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.940
if the lips are gone,
the teeth will feel the cold, too.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.070
Be it the Portuguese

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.080
or the Chinese,

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.420
since we live on the same land,

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.650
looking out for each other is
our only choice.
