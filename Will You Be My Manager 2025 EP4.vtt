You're a manager, so why are you acting?

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.870
<i>I thought she was just trying to leave a good impression.</i>

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.880
<i>I'm still collecting keychains of the key.</i>

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.890
<i>Why collect that trash?</i>

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.420
<i>The whole world's using electronic locks these days.</i>

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.570
<i>At least, that was before I noticed her uneasy smile.</i>

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.650
<i>By the way, I don't do funny content.</i>

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.110
<i>I didn't say a word about that.</i>

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.970
<i>At least, it was before I grew curious about Hana Hirose.</i>

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.870
<i>Why are you clinging to Eun Ho...</i>

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.050
<i>Stop messing with me!</i>

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200
<i>Suzu.</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

<i>Before I wanted to do things I never thought of.</i>

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.240
What do you mean?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.650
Sometimes, you have an uneasy smile, like right now.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.640
I didn't think it seemed so unsettling.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.710
But isn't smiling all the time better?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.310
A friend I really like always smiles brightly.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.020
That's just an act, but must you force a smile because of them?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.090
It's more comfortable to see you behave naturally.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.060
Maybe it's a culture difference.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.160
Hey, where are the chopsticks?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.020
Don't you have any?

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.470
Why would I have chopsticks? You should've brought them over.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.980
You brought so much stuff, but you don't have chopsticks?

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.990
Don't you use chopsticks to cook the noodles?
Why didn't you bring them over?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.120
But how were you planning to eat the chicken wings?

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.410
With my hands.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.160
I've never eaten them with my hands.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.410
What are you doing?

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.800
Someone forgot to take chopsticks and needs to go get them.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.150
Hang on. I have them in my manager bag.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.510
Where is it...

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.890
Here you go.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.390
And yours.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.840
You call that your manager bag?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.090
I thought it was a designer bag.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.820
I carry most essentials around.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.470
So adorable.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.050
The bag. It's cute.

<i>He's sharp.</i>

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.280
<i>Maybe it's the perceptiveness of an actor.</i>

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.190
Delicious. Would've been a real hassle
if we didn't have chopsticks.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.120
Yeah.

Why's that?

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.690
Because someone just won't leave me alone.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.740
I'm not trying to bother you.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.550
I'm just saying hi because we're friends.

Ji Ah, take the drinks.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.230
You look tired, so she brought it for you.

I don't need it, so don't bother.

We should wait until the final week,

The gap's really wide, and I've analyzed the success factors.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.370
Firstly, she has positively portrayed Eun Ho and Si Woo.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.440
She has also gathered a global fanbase.

Sure.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.010

What are you talking about?

- Hana-chan?
- Yeah.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.360
But she is really trash.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.880
Isn't that why you tossed her away?

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.000
Cut the crap and get to the point.
