00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:58.982
=Episode 10=

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.640
In the misty bamboo grove,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.680
she comes with quiet grace.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.359
Yunfei,

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.959
I heard there's a temple ahead.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.959
Its divinations are remarkably accurate.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.000
I never expected
the carefree Seventeenth Prince

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.400
to believe in Buddha.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:18.200
Do you believe in Buddha?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.680
(If gods and Buddhas truly existed,)

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.400
(how could they allow
all the evil in this world?)

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.480
(But it matters not.)

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.239
(Someone must dispense justice
in their stead.)

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:31.523
(Divination result)

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.280
Yunfei, look.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:37.480
Master.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640
Have you two come seeking marital fate?

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:41.480
No.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:42.480
How is it not?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.799
We are indeed here
seeking our marital fate.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.680
Judging by your faces,

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.319
you are truly a perfect match,

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.560
rare indeed.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.719
Of course.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.079
Which of you will draw
a fortune stick first?

00:02:01.408 --> 00:02:03.200
(The fourteenth lot)

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.488
Achieve your rightful place.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.479
This

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.080
is clearly a lucky sign.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:10.879
Master,

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.439
interpret it for us.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.000
Are this young lady and I
a match made in heaven?

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.879
You harbor affection for the lady.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.560
What a pity.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.120
Really a pity.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.080
What did you just say?

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:27.400
I mean

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.439
you two are blessed with a fine match
bestowed by heaven.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.319
Do not hesitate or waver,
lest you lose this destined union.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.560
Yunfei,

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:40.360
do you recall what I mentioned days ago

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.360
about proposing to you?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.919
Once peace returns to our lands,

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.280
I'll propose with all the honor
of a consort.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.159
Doesn't the fortune we drew today

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.199
clearly signifies

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.560
that our bond is ordained by heaven?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.120
Ordained by heaven?

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:58.759
Or perhaps by fortune?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.159
I...

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.319
They're here.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:09.080
Let's go.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.000
It's saltpeter.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.720
Someone uses the temple as cover,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.759
making gunpowder and weapons.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.920
Temples do refine elixirs,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.319
so if discovered,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.959
they can easily brush it off.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.959
How did you discover this?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.600
Chancellor Huo sent men
to tail and kill me.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.120
Am I not allowed to tail his men?

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.439
Chancellor Huo?

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.000
You mean...

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:40.600
He is no longer content

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.399
with being second only to the sovereign?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.560
He intends to rebel?

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:46.680
What a pity.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.279
Grand Tutor Xie isn't here today.

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:50.600
He misses this shattering secret.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.959
I wonder if his mission goes smoothly.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.040
Entering the fray alone,
risking everything,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.240
and willing to be your most useful pawn.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.000
Even I, his rival in love,

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.120
feel a sliver of admiration.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.639
But then again,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.920
am I not also a part of your plan?

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.000
Between us, it's merely
a mutually beneficial arrangement.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.279
It was before.

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.720
Now, it's not.

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.600
I wish to become
your more valuable piece.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.040
Alright, Yunfei?

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.439
Alright, move dishes.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.560
As expected, I still cannot beat you.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.920
I am filled with trepidation.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.199
Why such words?

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.959
Your Majesty,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.920
at first glance, this game seems

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.199
as if I hold the upper hand.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.720
Yet upon closer inspection,

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:55.160
you have laid a subtle trap,

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:56.879
encircling me.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.920
In chess,

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.839
you remain superior.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.639
Since you see through my scheme,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.199
how can it be called superior?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.199
Your move goes straight for the jugular.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.480
Even if I see it,

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.120
I can only submit.

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.839
Enough.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.920
I concede defeat.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.959
In chess, none surpasses you.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.240
You summoned me today

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.839
not merely to play a few games, right?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.199
I host a banquet at the academy tonight.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.360
Then,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.384
join me for a few drinks.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.360
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:08.120
Yunfei,

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:10.279
what you promised me is true, right?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.920
You truly wish to always be with me...

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:15.519
Always what?

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:18.319
Always.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.199
Always?

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.000
Winds are strong.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:29.160
I made you ginger soup.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.560
Remember to drink it.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.319
You're still here?

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:38.399
Sorry,

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.519
I didn't prepare ginger soup for you.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.319
It's fine, brother.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.279
Just don't catch a chill.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:46.480
Yunfei,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.519
don't forget what you promised me.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.040
What a jealous tone.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.560
What did you promise?

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:04.800
What will you always do?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.399
Didn't I tell you before?

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:12.360
You...

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.680
What prohibitions do you have

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.959
that I am unaware of?

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:20.120
And what else should I not do?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.959
Tell me.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.439
We've obtained the treasonous letter
forged by Jia Cheng.

00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.112
Chancellor Huo knows too.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.919
Huo Wan saved Jia Cheng back then.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.960
Next, they'll take the stage.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.480
We just need to watch the show unfold.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.480
Soon enough, we'll witness

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:46.279
a grand dog-eat-dog spectacle.

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:53.200
Brother,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.759
what exactly happened?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.720
What happened tonight
isn't for your eyes.

00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:58.519
Leave now.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.279
I still feel

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.960
it's too risky for you to go personally.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:11.879
The seeds he sowed that day

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.039
are the fruits he reaps today.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.080
Don't worry.

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:18.752
I know what I'm doing.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.039
Your Majesty,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.879
it's best to drink less cold wine
at night.

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.360
Don't harm your health.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.320
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.879
Well, Sheng Yunlin,

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:06.519
guess if the fires of abyss

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.480
will turn you to ashes

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.919
in an instant?

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.120
(It's you?)

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.840
(How can there be
such a striking resemblance?)

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.840
(She... She is...)

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.600
By the Seventeenth Prince of Qi
stands a woman

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:38.759
of remarkable agility,

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:40.440
who looks just like the Grand Princess.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.039
In my eyes, the woman

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.000
beside Grand Tutor Xie

00:10:54.159 --> 00:10:55.879
is also quite beautiful.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.639
Thank you for the kind words.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.279
This is my fiancée,

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.544
the third daughter of the Sheng family.

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:06.080
Yunnan's customs are liberal.

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:08.720
She enjoys traveling.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.000
She came to Zhuozhou to visit me.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.600
Learning of Your Majesty's
banquet today,

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:18.320
I took the liberty of bringing her
to broaden her horizons.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.120
Sister?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.799
How could you...

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:41.480
She is only nineteen and naturally shy.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.679
Forgive her if she amuses you.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.919
Your Majesty.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.639
Your Majesty!

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.720
Women from the Sheng family
often share similar features.

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:02.440
Had you not generously pardoned them,

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:05.240
how could a Sheng

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:08.440
be worthy of attending this banquet?

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:13.000
How could she
deserve you calling her Sister?

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.120
Grand Tutor Xie,

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:22.320
aren't you being too hasty?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.600
After all, she hasn't married you.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.639
How improper to parade her about.

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:29.799
You're right.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:33.639
Sit.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:35.328
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.080
Plain wine is dull.

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.840
I've arranged some fine entertainment.

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:56.039
Let us enjoy it together.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.159
Your Majesty, may I ask

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:01.440
what kind of entertainment is it?

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.879
So I may know and have fun too.

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.559
I heard an amusing tale
circulating recently.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.360
A scholar killed his own retainer,

00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:11.759
yet claimed his innocence.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.679
Hearing this story,

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.840
my curiosity is piqued.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.440
So I summoned you to this banquet
for personal questioning.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.679
(Why...)

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.600
(Why would he personally
interrogate Jia Cheng?)

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.360
(Three years ago)
Your Majesty.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.320
Ruthless and vicious,
with a vulture's heart and talons.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:57.120
This bears my father's style.

00:13:58.759 --> 00:14:01.559
You have given me a second life.

00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:04.200
I would give my life for you,

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.120
even at the cost of my life.

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:08.320
You write the letter
accusing the Grand Princess

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.960
of treason?

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:14.960
You mean...

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.559
Answer only yes or no.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.039
Yes, yes.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:18.840
Yes.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.799
Whether you live through today

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.759
depends entirely on your performance.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.279
Master Jia,

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:31.919
please recreate this letter identically.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.879
It truly matches the Grand Princess's
handwriting perfectly.
