Dearly beloved brothers and sisters,

00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:24.095
we are gathered here today to pray...

00:01:24.555 --> 00:01:28.925
for the eternal rest of Kim Mi Ran Julia.

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:34.805
Though her life in this world is over,

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.505
remember that her new life in Paradise has just begun,

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:45.375
and may it fill our hearts with hope.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:51.885
Julia was a wonderful mother and wife,

00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:54.125
and a dear friend.

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:57.395
Which means that...

00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:00.765
she was never alone.

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:04.795
Even now,

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:10.375
she is being sent off by her loving husband, daughter, and son,

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:16.305
and by the countless others who cherished her.

00:02:19.275 --> 00:02:21.785
Letting go of a loved one...

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:24.855
is so painful and difficult.

00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:29.355
But the Lord gives us hope.

00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:33.125
We pray that the Lord will comfort us...

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:35.625
and bestow...

00:02:36.195 --> 00:02:39.935
his peace and grace upon all of us...

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:42.265
who remain.

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:44.675
Amen.

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:53.515
I should get going.

00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:55.015
Thanks for coming.

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:59.355
My poor, dear sister.

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:01.555
- Go on. - Okay.

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:03.325
She had such a hard life.

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:08.225
You poor things. What are you going to do?

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:10.735
Goodness.

00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:16.835
Yes, hello?

00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:21.375
- Yes, of course. Yes. - Jin Ho looks just as dead.

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:24.545
Return gifts? For those, we usually...

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:26.845
Jun Kyung, be sure to take good care of your dad.

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:29.045
- Yes, the 30-count... - I will.

00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:32.315
- Take care of yourselves too. - is practical and durable.

00:03:32.385 --> 00:03:34.625
And the 40-count is softer and more luxurious.

00:03:34.685 --> 00:03:35.685
- Go take that somewhere else. - Yes.

00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:38.155
I see. It's for a first birthday party.

00:03:51.405 --> 00:03:53.005
It's like no one's even sad.

00:03:55.105 --> 00:03:56.105
It's like...

00:03:57.415 --> 00:03:59.445
they just showed up to check a box.

00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:02.915
Everyone just has their own way of grieving.

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:10.555
Jun Kyung, I'm leaving.

00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:15.525
- I'm going to go. - Okay. Take care.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:28.875
A lot of people came.

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:34.585
You're right.

00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:39.955
Too bad they didn't visit when she was still alive.

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:49.325
(Julia, Kim Mi Ran)

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:52.935
(Kim Mi Ran)

00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:06.645
Let's go.

00:05:07.785 --> 00:05:09.415
Your mom should get some rest now.

00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:28.335
I'll stay with Jun Seo.

00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:49.725
It's okay.

00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:02.565
- What do you mean? I saw you look! - Seriously, I really didn't!

00:06:02.635 --> 00:06:03.705
I saw you look!

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:05.935
There's been a misunderstanding, so if you could just...

00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:08.745
- Then let's just check the CCTV. - Jun Seo.

00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:09.845
I said, let's see the CCTV!

00:06:09.905 --> 00:06:11.215
It's not a big deal. We don't need the CCTV.

00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:12.575
It's not a big deal?

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:15.345
He was checking out my girlfriend, and you say it's not a big deal?

00:06:15.415 --> 00:06:16.485
Hey, Seo Jun Seo!

00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:22.255
What? What did I do wrong?

00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:24.495
Did you have to make a scene here? You're embarrassing me!

00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:27.595
It's you who should be ashamed! Did you have to wear that here?

00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:33.095
What?

00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:36.405
You think that outfit is appropriate for a place like this?

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:41.945
I didn't dress this way for this. This is just how I always dress.

00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:43.005
This is me.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:46.675
I hate it!

00:06:47.085 --> 00:06:49.185
I hate the way you're always dressing like that!

00:06:54.055 --> 00:06:57.255
And I hate how you dress like that and post it all over social media.

00:06:57.525 --> 00:06:59.925
And I hate seeing all the guys thirsting over your posts.

00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:06.935
Do you have any idea how lonely you make me feel?

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.145
Hey, Yoon Sol.

00:07:19.715 --> 00:07:20.715
Hey, Yoon Sol!

00:07:34.565 --> 00:07:35.825
What I ruined...

00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:42.605
was Mom's last day.

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:52.475
I thought we'd have another chance.

00:08:05.355 --> 00:08:06.725
Your mother and I...

00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:09.425
Well, things weren't always easy.

00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:13.565
But I thought if we just stayed as we were,

00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:16.835
we'd grow old together.

00:08:19.635 --> 00:08:21.575
Maybe take a nice trip once in a while,

00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:25.914
watch the sunset side by side...

00:08:25.915 --> 00:08:28.845
while eating some ice cream, and sing songs.

00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:34.225
And go on that yacht your mother always wanted to.

00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:42.765
It's sad when someone dies.

00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:46.895
But it's the things they wanted to do.

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:51.705
The things your mother and I planned to do together.

00:08:56.305 --> 00:08:59.275
It feels like all those things vanished right along with her.

00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:11.355
Excuse me, could you pull over for a second?

00:09:13.695 --> 00:09:14.695
What is it, Dad?

00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:24.405
Dad?

00:09:25.205 --> 00:09:26.205
Go on.

00:10:47.015 --> 00:10:48.254
The person you have reached is unavailable.

00:10:48.255 --> 00:10:50.225
Please leave a message...

00:13:28.485 --> 00:13:29.685
(Seah Women's Hospital)

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:30.785
You okay?

00:13:34.255 --> 00:13:37.185
The patient's cervix is dilated, and her contractions are irregular.

00:13:38.225 --> 00:13:39.555
I'm asking about you.

00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:42.025
Are you okay?

00:13:45.665 --> 00:13:46.965
I'm fine.

00:13:49.235 --> 00:13:52.035
Please. You're just putting on a brave face.

00:13:52.235 --> 00:13:54.505
How could you possibly be okay?

00:13:55.405 --> 00:13:58.215
The neighbour's guitar music was actually comforting.

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:00.545
What are you talking about?

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:05.655
Someone's born, and someone dies.

00:14:08.885 --> 00:14:12.395
Someone's paying me a salary, so I have to do my job.

00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:14.965
You're not thinking straight.

00:14:14.966 --> 00:14:17.535
I'm a pro. My private matters are separate.

00:14:18.895 --> 00:14:19.895
Okay?

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:25.005
- Honey, should I wait outside? - No, don't go. Please.

00:14:25.675 --> 00:14:27.605
You can't hold back now. Push.

00:14:29.005 --> 00:14:32.275
- Breathe. Don't hold your breath. - Honey, breathe!

00:14:32.715 --> 00:14:34.415
The mother needs to breathe, not the father.

00:14:34.485 --> 00:14:36.445
I can't do this. I feel like I'm going to die.

00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:39.815
- It feels like it, but you won't. - Honey!

00:14:39.885 --> 00:14:41.685
No one else can do this for you.

00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:44.295
Is this pathetic side of you what you want to show your daughter?

00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:50.125
You're not going to be a mother who gets her leg cut off...

00:14:51.165 --> 00:14:52.865
in a car accident on a rainy day, are you?

00:14:56.335 --> 00:14:57.435
A mother who fights with her daughter...

00:14:59.335 --> 00:15:00.375
and never gets the chance to make up.

00:15:03.645 --> 00:15:04.875
One who dies...

00:15:05.575 --> 00:15:07.345
from a brain haemorrhage, are you?

00:15:08.545 --> 00:15:10.345
What in the world are you talking about?

00:15:14.755 --> 00:15:15.955
(Admissions, Billing, Consultation Room)

00:15:22.395 --> 00:15:23.395
Well, well.

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:26.465
If it isn't the professional who separates work and life.

00:15:27.195 --> 00:15:30.235
You're the talk of the hospital.

00:15:30.365 --> 00:15:32.935
They're saying Dr. Seo Jun Kyung pioneered a new delivery method.

00:15:34.305 --> 00:15:36.705
I can only imagine how confused that poor patient was.

00:15:37.175 --> 00:15:40.075
She was having a boy, but you kept screaming "daughter."

00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:43.515
I bet the baby was shocked at birth. "Mom, am I a girl?"

00:15:45.555 --> 00:15:47.925
I'm really not in the mood for this.

00:15:49.685 --> 00:15:50.955
Who's joking?

00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:53.655
I was actually going to say you did well.

00:15:56.995 --> 00:16:01.265
So our ice queen, Seo Jun Kyung, has a heart after all.

00:16:03.405 --> 00:16:05.775
You may have looked a little unhinged,

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:07.675
but who cares?

00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:09.845
You did good.

00:16:16.315 --> 00:16:18.355
Do you think my mom ever loved me?

00:16:20.215 --> 00:16:21.485
Thinking back on it,

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:25.255
her saying "I love you..."

00:16:25.855 --> 00:16:28.395
I don't think I ever heard her say it once.

00:16:30.395 --> 00:16:31.995
After we bust our bottoms raising our daughters,

00:16:32.535 --> 00:16:34.405
they will probably say the same nonsense.

00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:38.775
As if you have ever said that to your mom.

00:16:42.745 --> 00:16:46.615
I thought I'd get to have at least 40 more meals with her.

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:52.285
Seriously.

00:16:53.855 --> 00:16:55.785
So irresponsible, right to the very end.

00:16:58.955 --> 00:17:00.155
You know what?

00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:04.435
I will never ever die before my daughter.

00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:07.735
How inspiring.

00:17:08.265 --> 00:17:11.235
A mother whose biggest ambition is to outlive her own daughter.

00:17:11.305 --> 00:17:14.845
- Right? I'll be an amazing mom! - Give me a break.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:18.145
No, Jun Kyung. That's enough.

00:17:19.515 --> 00:17:21.085
What? You're leaving already?

00:17:21.315 --> 00:17:22.315
Look.

00:17:22.815 --> 00:17:26.355
My daughters are desperately trying to reach me.

00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:30.155
Don't answer it. Don't.

00:17:30.785 --> 00:17:32.025
Hi, sweetie.

00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:34.365
Yes?

00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:37.065
Did Daddy make you something yummy?

00:17:45.235 --> 00:17:52.245
(Mom)

00:18:07.355 --> 00:18:10.095
(My Daughter)

00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:25.575
Mom.

00:18:38.225 --> 00:18:39.225
Hi, Jun Kyung.

00:18:40.895 --> 00:18:43.395
I was just getting the laundry in. It started raining all of a sudden.

00:18:47.765 --> 00:18:51.505
Gosh, you're so forgetful. Pull yourself together.

00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:53.805
For crying out loud. Where is it?

00:18:56.345 --> 00:18:58.845
- Mom, where are you? - I'm almost there.

00:18:59.115 --> 00:19:00.915
Quit hounding me.

00:19:00.985 --> 00:19:03.445
See? I told you to send a courier, especially since it's raining.

00:19:03.515 --> 00:19:06.615
A courier? Are we made of money? It's a quick drive.

00:19:06.685 --> 00:19:09.155
- So where are you now? - I just passed Hoam Station.

00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:10.425
Okay, I'm heading out now.

00:19:30.175 --> 00:19:31.545
Mom, what's taking you so long?

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.015
Hurry up!

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:48.994
(Yeonsu Hospital)

00:19:48.995 --> 00:19:55.805
(Yeonsu Hospital)

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.345
I told you not to come.

00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:43.245
I told you not to come, didn't I?

00:20:49.025 --> 00:20:50.185
I told you it was raining.

00:20:54.525 --> 00:20:56.025
Because it was raining.

00:20:57.525 --> 00:20:59.795
I told you not to come.

00:21:11.315 --> 00:21:13.075
It's not your fault, Jun Kyung.

00:21:16.345 --> 00:21:17.645
It's not your fault.

00:21:19.815 --> 00:21:21.154
Don't cry.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:22.455
Don't cry, Jun Kyung.

00:21:24.695 --> 00:21:26.125
It's not your fault.

00:21:56.385 --> 00:21:57.385
- Gosh. - It's starting to rain!

00:21:59.925 --> 00:22:01.595
So, what should we get to eat?

00:22:31.155 --> 00:22:32.155
Hey!

00:22:32.895 --> 00:22:34.025
Hey, Seo Jun Seo!

00:22:35.265 --> 00:22:36.295
Hey!

00:22:39.465 --> 00:22:40.695
(Fast pitch: only 1 player allowed, 10 dollars for 17 pitches)

00:22:48.705 --> 00:22:49.705
Seriously!

00:22:52.545 --> 00:22:54.075
Please let me get one hit.

00:22:55.585 --> 00:22:56.585
One hit!

00:23:07.995 --> 00:23:09.525
Hey, mister!

00:23:10.695 --> 00:23:11.795
Mister!

00:23:12.595 --> 00:23:14.965
- Mister... - What's wrong?

00:23:15.035 --> 00:23:16.635
Mister, please help me.

00:23:17.905 --> 00:23:20.205
- My neck is stuck. - What are you doing in the rain?

00:24:03.685 --> 00:24:04.715
We meet again.

00:24:07.885 --> 00:24:08.885
Right.

00:24:10.385 --> 00:24:13.895
Oh, dear. I seem to have forgotten the code to my place.

00:24:14.155 --> 00:24:15.195
Can you believe it?

00:24:17.725 --> 00:24:19.395
Why don't you ask your husband to let you in?

00:24:20.165 --> 00:24:21.405
My husband?

00:24:26.805 --> 00:24:28.305
Right. My husband.

00:24:29.175 --> 00:24:31.975
He's on a business trip. Way out of town.

00:24:34.445 --> 00:24:36.345
You could just call and ask him.

00:24:41.355 --> 00:24:44.895
Darn it. Perfect timing.

00:24:48.225 --> 00:24:51.125
Where is it? Come on, where is my phone?

00:24:53.095 --> 00:24:54.135
Really.

00:24:57.065 --> 00:24:58.835
- Gosh. - Your phone is ringing.

00:25:06.315 --> 00:25:07.875
Hey, what's our passcode?

00:25:14.285 --> 00:25:15.285
The ER?

00:25:23.695 --> 00:25:24.795
Which hospital?

00:25:28.565 --> 00:25:29.805
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:25:41.275 --> 00:25:44.085
Look. I'll give you a ride.

00:25:44.515 --> 00:25:46.085
No, that's okay.

00:25:46.985 --> 00:25:48.985
- Isn't it urgent? - It is.

00:25:52.595 --> 00:25:53.595
Get in.

00:25:56.365 --> 00:25:57.865
- In that? - Yes.

00:25:58.535 --> 00:26:00.735
- Whose car is it? - It's my car.

00:26:01.705 --> 00:26:03.064
- It's mine. - But...

00:26:03.065 --> 00:26:04.405
- The ambulance... - Shouldn't we head to the ER?

00:26:04.465 --> 00:26:06.335
Whose car?

00:26:06.835 --> 00:26:08.505
- It's my car. - Hold on.

00:26:10.005 --> 00:26:11.005
It hurts.

00:26:13.445 --> 00:26:14.515
Jun Kyung.

00:26:15.685 --> 00:26:17.045
What? Have you been drinking?

00:26:18.555 --> 00:26:20.015
I see you're thriving.

00:26:20.655 --> 00:26:22.755
What are you writing your thesis on? Some kind of baseball-fusion theory?

00:26:22.825 --> 00:26:24.995
Your brother's in this condition, and that's the first thing you say?

00:26:25.055 --> 00:26:28.125
I heard everything from the nurse. You pulled a muscle swinging at air,

00:26:28.195 --> 00:26:31.065
and you're fine. They said you can remove the neck brace soon.

00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:34.435
"Fine?" I was practically dying. I'm only up because of the drugs.

00:26:35.065 --> 00:26:38.635
- I never should've called you. - You wanted me to pay the bill.

00:26:38.705 --> 00:26:41.075
Don't pay it! I mean it, don't you dare pay that bill.

00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:44.775
Really? Then, mind if I take your wallet?

00:26:45.945 --> 00:26:47.715
How can one person be so infuriating?

00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:49.415
Seriously.

00:26:56.985 --> 00:26:57.985
I'm sorry.

00:26:59.055 --> 00:27:00.055
No, don't be.

00:27:00.725 --> 00:27:01.895
I'm the one who's sorry.

00:27:06.265 --> 00:27:08.105
No, I'm really sorry.

00:27:10.165 --> 00:27:13.435
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

00:27:14.435 --> 00:27:18.005
Don't cry. It's my fault, okay?

00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:21.115
Look at me. Look at me, Sol.

00:27:22.485 --> 00:27:23.915
Why are you crying?

00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:27.415
Your poor neck.

00:27:29.555 --> 00:27:31.595
- I really love you. - Come here.

00:27:31.655 --> 00:27:33.125
I love you more.

00:27:34.325 --> 00:27:35.295
I love you!

00:27:40.895 --> 00:27:42.005
Hey, Sol.

00:27:46.735 --> 00:27:47.935
Hello, Jun Kyung.

00:27:49.775 --> 00:27:50.775
Hello.

00:27:51.575 --> 00:27:52.575
Hello.

00:27:53.845 --> 00:27:57.515
And you are?

00:27:58.685 --> 00:28:00.285
What? Right, so this is...

00:28:04.085 --> 00:28:05.125
And your name was?

00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:07.424
I'm Ju Do Hyun.

00:28:07.425 --> 00:28:09.695
Right, Ju Do Hyun. He's my neighbour.

00:28:10.695 --> 00:28:13.595
Wait, you live next door? Then why are you together this late?

00:28:15.435 --> 00:28:16.435
What?

00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:19.905
Your sister and I...

00:28:21.805 --> 00:28:22.975
were on a date...

00:28:24.545 --> 00:28:26.075
when she got your urgent call.

00:28:33.615 --> 00:28:36.525
Why would you say we were on a date? He's going to get the wrong idea.

00:28:37.025 --> 00:28:38.355
My apologies.

00:28:39.355 --> 00:28:41.025
Especially since you have a husband.

00:28:50.165 --> 00:28:52.675
Actually, I'm not married.

00:28:57.505 --> 00:28:58.515
I know.

00:29:00.245 --> 00:29:01.375
Is it obvious?

00:29:04.615 --> 00:29:05.915
You're 36.

00:29:07.515 --> 00:29:08.785
- A doctor at Seah Hospital. - A doctor at Seah Hospital.

00:29:08.855 --> 00:29:11.055
Family-wise, parents and a younger brother.

00:29:11.425 --> 00:29:13.895
Height is 167cm. Weight...

00:29:14.155 --> 00:29:15.695
It's a little more than I was told.

00:29:21.435 --> 00:29:26.435
It was a gorgeous car, but I got sick of it in two years.

00:29:27.235 --> 00:29:28.945
And you start seeing them everywhere.

00:29:29.805 --> 00:29:31.875
- So I just switched to a Maserati. - I already booked a room.

00:29:34.915 --> 00:29:40.015
Maserati actually has a team of engine sound design engineers.

00:29:40.715 --> 00:29:44.385
- They're pianists and composers... - So you want sex, is that it?

00:29:45.395 --> 00:29:46.895
We just met today,

00:29:47.395 --> 00:29:48.725
and it hasn't even been an hour.

00:29:49.895 --> 00:29:52.495
Hey. Please keep your voice down.

00:29:52.565 --> 00:29:55.035
You're right. That way, we don't waste any time,

00:29:55.105 --> 00:29:57.965
and we can quickly see if we're compatible or not.

00:29:59.705 --> 00:30:00.735
My apologies.

00:30:02.845 --> 00:30:03.845
Keep it.

00:30:04.305 --> 00:30:07.675
You wasted your time on a woman you won't get. Don't waste money.

00:30:08.945 --> 00:30:10.215
Rude to the very end, aren't you?

00:30:42.345 --> 00:30:43.785
My date was a total bore,

00:30:45.055 --> 00:30:46.315
but that was entertaining.

00:30:48.525 --> 00:30:49.555
It was impressive.

00:30:50.425 --> 00:30:52.455
Downing your drink and storming out.

00:30:52.855 --> 00:30:56.265
I'm not usually like that.

00:30:57.995 --> 00:30:59.035
Really?

00:31:00.495 --> 00:31:04.365
I don't know. Maybe I am.

00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:13.075
Want to listen to some music?

00:31:15.245 --> 00:31:17.245
Something that will boost my self-esteem, please.

00:31:41.235 --> 00:31:42.245
One second.

00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:04.425
That way.

00:32:24.145 --> 00:32:25.955
Remember your password?

00:32:40.665 --> 00:32:42.565
It's nice having a good neighbour.

00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:46.735
About that...

00:32:48.335 --> 00:32:51.245
I won't be your neighbour for much longer.

00:32:54.115 --> 00:32:55.285
I'm moving out soon.

00:32:58.245 --> 00:33:00.915
I see. Is that so?

00:33:06.155 --> 00:33:07.195
It's a shame, isn't it?

00:33:15.435 --> 00:33:18.165
Now that...

00:33:23.145 --> 00:33:24.505
we won't run into each other anymore,

00:33:30.745 --> 00:33:32.185
how about we meet on purpose for a change?

00:33:59.815 --> 00:34:02.345
You said you wanted the lowest possible rate,

00:34:03.085 --> 00:34:05.715
so you signed up for the non-refundable package.

00:34:08.215 --> 00:34:10.385
I'm sorry, but we can't offer you a refund.

00:34:13.795 --> 00:34:15.055
As I said,

00:34:17.195 --> 00:34:19.235
my wife, whom I was going with, has passed away.

00:34:19.965 --> 00:34:22.605
I'm very sorry to hear that.

00:34:23.965 --> 00:34:26.275
But there's nothing we can do.

00:34:33.515 --> 00:34:35.785
We hope you have a pleasant trip.

00:34:39.015 --> 00:34:43.385
(Golden Tour)

00:35:00.135 --> 00:35:02.674
Julia held the family together.

00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:05.175
She handled everything, including the kids.

00:35:05.645 --> 00:35:08.175
She worked so hard to raise those kids right.

00:35:10.215 --> 00:35:13.355
I wonder how poor, helpless Raphael will manage on his own.

00:35:13.615 --> 00:35:15.525
I'm just so worried about him...

00:35:16.055 --> 00:35:18.284
Raphael? I'll see you on Sunday.

00:35:18.285 --> 00:35:19.295
Raphael!

00:35:19.725 --> 00:35:20.755
Raphael.

00:35:23.165 --> 00:35:24.225
Hello.

00:35:24.795 --> 00:35:29.665
Something came up, so I couldn't make it to the funeral.

00:35:31.135 --> 00:35:32.175
That's all right.

00:35:32.905 --> 00:35:37.845
Our dear Julia. She seemed so well, but then she was gone so suddenly.

00:35:41.015 --> 00:35:44.545
I heard it was a beautiful service.

00:35:44.645 --> 00:35:46.955
Just the right number of mourners came,

00:35:47.055 --> 00:35:50.355
and the priest's eulogy was magnificent.

00:35:52.295 --> 00:35:55.525
My goodness, the death of a spouse...

00:35:55.965 --> 00:35:59.335
They say it's the most stressful event in a person's life.

00:35:59.935 --> 00:36:02.535
Are you holding up okay, Raphael?

00:36:04.635 --> 00:36:07.535
Can you take this off? I don't need it.

00:36:10.975 --> 00:36:12.875
This poor man...

00:36:49.385 --> 00:36:52.715
Raphael. I thought you'd left. Is something wrong?

00:36:52.785 --> 00:36:54.784
My goodness! Raphael!

00:36:54.785 --> 00:36:56.155
Someone died, and you call it what?

00:36:56.955 --> 00:36:57.985
"A beautiful funeral?"

00:36:58.055 --> 00:37:01.125
Goodness, Raphael. Raphael, what's gotten into you?

00:37:01.295 --> 00:37:06.065
- Oh, my! - No funeral is beautiful!

00:37:06.135 --> 00:37:07.365
He's lost his mind.

00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:12.375
Oh, my gosh, he's lost his mind. He's lost it!

00:37:21.875 --> 00:37:23.415
Why are you still here, Raphael?

00:37:24.515 --> 00:37:26.885
You're all right, aren't you?

00:37:28.155 --> 00:37:30.455
Yes. I'm fine.

00:37:31.655 --> 00:37:34.655
Julia will always be watching over you.

00:37:35.625 --> 00:37:37.465
- Thank you. - Of course.

00:37:50.605 --> 00:37:51.805
I mean...

00:37:52.445 --> 00:37:54.975
It hasn't even been that long since my mom passed away.

00:37:55.275 --> 00:37:58.145
And I keep wondering if I should even be doing this.

00:37:58.345 --> 00:38:02.225
Do you think someone's just going to show up at the perfect time for you,

00:38:02.425 --> 00:38:05.955
and ask, "So, is now a good time? Perfect for dating, right?"

00:38:06.555 --> 00:38:10.325
You're no service tech,

00:38:10.395 --> 00:38:12.564
but to give away your number like that...

00:38:12.565 --> 00:38:13.835
- to a guy? - For real?

00:38:14.095 --> 00:38:16.965
Hey, that was just because he said he was moving.

00:38:17.535 --> 00:38:19.075
So I just got caught up in the moment.

00:38:19.535 --> 00:38:20.575
I must've been out of my mind.

00:38:20.635 --> 00:38:23.444
You won't know till you meet him.

00:38:23.445 --> 00:38:25.415
It's not like you must marry him or have kids with him.

00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:27.445
- You're just seeing what he's like. - Exactly.

00:38:27.775 --> 00:38:28.785
Right?

00:38:30.785 --> 00:38:34.355
No, I did get the address, but... No way.

00:38:36.655 --> 00:38:38.655
Guys, that guy's wearing a hoodie again.

00:38:38.955 --> 00:38:39.955
A hoodie?

00:38:40.225 --> 00:38:41.225
Did they meet?

00:38:41.555 --> 00:38:44.125
Is he underdressed, or am I overdressed?

00:38:44.195 --> 00:38:47.565
Hey, who knows? Maybe he's the CEO of some hot startup.

00:38:47.765 --> 00:38:48.805
Hand it over to me.

00:38:49.905 --> 00:38:53.505
Jun Kyung. Hey, first of all, don't just say what comes to mind.

00:38:53.575 --> 00:38:55.575
That thought... No, you know what? Just don't think at all, okay?

00:38:55.645 --> 00:38:56.845
No, wait. That's not right.

00:38:56.905 --> 00:38:58.205
Whatever you want to do, don't do it. Okay?

00:38:58.275 --> 00:38:59.275
He saw me. I've got to go.

00:39:02.415 --> 00:39:05.345
Jun Kyung? What? Okay? Hello?

00:39:06.455 --> 00:39:07.455
What?

00:39:08.285 --> 00:39:09.285
Were you on the phone?

00:39:10.885 --> 00:39:12.795
- I hope things go well. - Was she on the phone?

00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:13.855
She was.

00:39:17.895 --> 00:39:18.895
Excuse me!

00:39:19.435 --> 00:39:20.595
Another bottle of soju?

00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:22.835
Ma'am!

00:39:25.135 --> 00:39:26.635
You're here early.

00:39:27.275 --> 00:39:28.475
Yes, I got here super early.

00:39:29.545 --> 00:39:32.975
This place is super popular. If you're late, the line is insane.

00:39:33.075 --> 00:39:36.785
- I see. - This pork rind is amazing. Cheers!

00:39:55.295 --> 00:39:57.105
- This is awkward, isn't it? - Sorry?

00:39:58.835 --> 00:40:00.335
Yes, a little...

00:40:03.445 --> 00:40:04.475
Of course it is.

00:40:05.175 --> 00:40:06.575
We've only ever run into each other.

00:40:07.675 --> 00:40:09.185
This is the first time we've actually...

00:40:17.225 --> 00:40:18.625
Don't you have any questions for me?

00:40:19.995 --> 00:40:20.995
Well, I...

00:40:22.195 --> 00:40:24.525
I know a little bit about you, Jun Kyung.

00:40:29.535 --> 00:40:30.605
It's just...

00:40:32.135 --> 00:40:34.375
I feel like I know a little bit about you too.

00:40:43.885 --> 00:40:44.915
Let's see...

00:40:49.385 --> 00:40:52.655
You seem a little younger than me.

00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:57.025
Maybe 35?

00:40:57.795 --> 00:41:01.165
You'd better not be married, of course.

00:41:06.535 --> 00:41:08.135
And your job...

00:41:10.805 --> 00:41:11.805
Something in the arts?

00:41:13.175 --> 00:41:14.545
A starving artist, I presume?

00:41:15.345 --> 00:41:17.315
- It shows? - Really?

00:41:26.995 --> 00:41:30.795
He's charming. He's even kind of cute, in a way.

00:41:31.395 --> 00:41:32.435
But...

00:41:33.235 --> 00:41:36.535
the fact that he's 35 and still just doing music...

00:41:36.665 --> 00:41:39.905
For some reason, that doesn't feel like a real job to me.

00:41:42.105 --> 00:41:43.805
So what kind of music does he make?

00:41:45.945 --> 00:41:47.545
How should I describe it?

00:41:49.545 --> 00:41:50.585
It's just, you know...

00:41:51.815 --> 00:41:52.885
A bit of this and that.

00:41:55.255 --> 00:41:56.385
Whatever feels right.

00:41:59.955 --> 00:42:01.255
I pretty much do it all.

00:42:02.095 --> 00:42:03.495
He doesn't even know what he's doing.

00:42:04.525 --> 00:42:05.665
Does that remind you of anyone?

00:42:06.095 --> 00:42:07.095
Who?

00:42:09.465 --> 00:42:12.574
One guy still in a rebellious phase is more than enough,

00:42:12.575 --> 00:42:14.435
and that's Seo Jun Seo.

00:42:15.535 --> 00:42:17.905
- So he's broke? - Come on, do I even need to ask?

00:42:18.175 --> 00:42:19.175
Gosh.

00:42:19.675 --> 00:42:23.045
"If you don't mind me asking, what's your annual salary?"

00:42:24.345 --> 00:42:27.755
"Are you self-sufficient? Are you a night owl who works late?"

00:42:27.815 --> 00:42:29.725
"Because I'm a morning person with a 9-to-5."

00:42:29.785 --> 00:42:31.985
You should've asked him those things since you were already out with him.

00:42:32.055 --> 00:42:33.295
If a guy were to ask,

00:42:33.655 --> 00:42:36.125
"How much do you weigh? What's your waist size?"

00:42:36.195 --> 00:42:39.365
"What's your body fat percentage?" Would you tell him on a first date?

00:42:40.265 --> 00:42:42.095
- Sure, I'd tell him. - I'd tell him.

00:42:42.165 --> 00:42:43.165
I've got nothing to hide.

00:42:45.305 --> 00:42:46.405
I wish someone would ask me.

00:42:54.015 --> 00:42:55.575
For a guy his age...

00:42:58.185 --> 00:43:00.715
What did he have to sacrifice for that kind of freedom?

00:43:01.955 --> 00:43:03.625
Wealth and fame?

00:43:04.555 --> 00:43:05.555
Exactly.

00:43:06.025 --> 00:43:10.365
I'm not sure I could handle that kind of freedom.

00:43:16.465 --> 00:43:17.465
Here, try some.

00:43:23.145 --> 00:43:26.015
- You must have burned yourself. - I did.

00:43:26.445 --> 00:43:28.175
No, I don't want to handle it.

00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:31.145
When it's already hard enough to find...

00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:33.655
things you have in common with someone,

00:43:34.015 --> 00:43:38.625
you're just hunting for things you dislike or don't have in common.

00:43:38.755 --> 00:43:39.925
You're actively looking for them.

00:43:39.995 --> 00:43:42.125
I'm not hunting for them. They're just obvious.

00:43:42.355 --> 00:43:45.165
Obvious? What's so obvious? Is this a game of Tetris to you?

00:43:45.425 --> 00:43:47.765
You have this void you've built up from all your insecurities,

00:43:47.835 --> 00:43:49.965
and you expect some guy to just slot in there perfectly?

00:43:50.035 --> 00:43:52.475
If you only wait for the long piece, it's game over.

00:43:52.575 --> 00:43:57.475
Do you think she'll ever find a guy who'll sweep her off her feet?

00:43:57.575 --> 00:44:00.245
No, that alone won't do it. We're out of booze.

00:44:00.315 --> 00:44:02.445
- She'd have to be possessed. - And we're out of booze.

00:44:02.745 --> 00:44:03.845
Hey, hold on a second.

00:44:06.285 --> 00:44:08.015
I thought as long as a guy was hot enough...

00:44:08.655 --> 00:44:11.155
for you to just live off his looks, that was good enough for you.

00:44:12.385 --> 00:44:13.725
That's what I thought too.

00:44:15.695 --> 00:44:17.825
But I guess I'm more materialistic than I realised.

00:44:24.235 --> 00:44:25.335
What?

00:44:28.735 --> 00:44:30.045
Is that really all he said?

00:44:37.515 --> 00:44:38.515
The truth is...

00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:44.225
I was certain about something.

00:44:46.325 --> 00:44:47.325
Certain about what?

00:44:49.325 --> 00:44:50.965
That you, Jun Kyung,

00:44:53.665 --> 00:44:55.565
would need me.

00:45:06.545 --> 00:45:07.875
They say attraction...

00:45:09.485 --> 00:45:11.485
starts with observation.

00:45:13.215 --> 00:45:14.815
I feel like I heard that somewhere.

00:45:19.125 --> 00:45:20.195
And I...

00:45:21.655 --> 00:45:22.795
unintentionally...

00:45:24.325 --> 00:45:26.535
ended up observing you, Jun Kyung.

00:45:29.335 --> 00:45:30.505
Almost every day.

00:45:45.685 --> 00:45:46.855
(2:32am)

00:45:53.825 --> 00:45:55.355
(Delicious Anytime! New Ramen Meal Kit Available Now!)

00:46:39.905 --> 00:46:41.135
You looked lonely.

00:46:44.175 --> 00:46:45.305
You did, Jun Kyung.

00:46:47.375 --> 00:46:48.375
It was as if...

00:46:49.845 --> 00:46:51.545
you were trying to be lonely.

00:46:52.985 --> 00:46:54.655
If that makes any sense.

00:46:57.885 --> 00:46:58.885
But...

00:46:59.925 --> 00:47:02.795
who in the world actually tries to be lonely?

00:47:15.805 --> 00:47:20.975
(The Guy Next Door)

00:47:39.095 --> 00:47:40.235
Did you get home okay?

00:47:40.295 --> 00:47:41.535
(The Guy Next Door)

00:47:51.345 --> 00:47:53.515
(Charging will be complete in...)

00:48:00.715 --> 00:48:01.885
For goodness' sake.

00:48:23.575 --> 00:48:24.575
What's up?

00:48:27.575 --> 00:48:29.075
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:48:31.845 --> 00:48:32.955
We'll talk when I get there.

00:48:47.295 --> 00:48:49.095
We keep running into each other like this.

00:48:58.345 --> 00:49:00.315
I was worried. I couldn't get a hold of you.

00:49:08.615 --> 00:49:10.655
Did I do something wrong last time?

00:49:12.485 --> 00:49:13.495
No.

00:49:14.995 --> 00:49:17.025
So it was the restaurant. I knew it.

00:49:29.035 --> 00:49:30.145
I just thought...

00:49:31.705 --> 00:49:33.075
that we were both...

00:49:34.015 --> 00:49:35.415
really comfortable together,

00:49:37.345 --> 00:49:38.985
and that we really hit it off.

00:49:43.725 --> 00:49:45.155
In what way do we "hit it off?"

00:49:51.395 --> 00:49:52.395
Fair point.

00:49:52.965 --> 00:49:55.195
Which means...

00:49:56.035 --> 00:49:58.035
all we need to do is get in sync.

00:50:00.235 --> 00:50:01.905
Get to know each other better.

00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:15.785
Then again...

00:50:18.085 --> 00:50:19.455
I guess no response was an answer in itself.

00:50:24.565 --> 00:50:26.025
It's not just you.

00:50:28.265 --> 00:50:30.265
I'm not interested in getting to know anyone right now.

00:50:48.755 --> 00:50:51.755
(Golden Tour)

00:51:00.595 --> 00:51:02.265
You can't be serious.

00:51:02.905 --> 00:51:05.665
You said you booked this trip for Mom, right?

00:51:06.035 --> 00:51:08.335
So you should obviously cancel. You're not going alone, are you?

00:51:11.705 --> 00:51:13.575
Then you take Dad to Jeju Island.

00:51:14.215 --> 00:51:16.415
- If you want to go so bad, you go. - You think I'm not busy?

00:51:16.485 --> 00:51:17.485
What, and you think I am?

00:51:19.585 --> 00:51:20.585
Jun Seo.

00:51:21.055 --> 00:51:22.815
- Look, son... - Aren't you even sad?

00:51:23.855 --> 00:51:24.855
Aren't you?

00:51:28.655 --> 00:51:30.195
Why is no one else sad?

00:51:31.295 --> 00:51:32.295
Why?

00:51:34.565 --> 00:51:35.665
You know, I...

00:51:36.265 --> 00:51:39.035
For seven years now, since your mom's accident...

00:51:39.105 --> 00:51:40.335
So what, you're happy now?

00:51:40.905 --> 00:51:43.045
Going to some fancy resort to celebrate Mom's death?

00:52:31.425 --> 00:52:33.055
Seo Jun Seo. Watch your mouth.

00:52:40.535 --> 00:52:41.535
That's rich, coming from you.

00:52:44.305 --> 00:52:46.635
Don't you remember the last thing you said to Mom before she died?

00:52:47.275 --> 00:52:48.605
That she looked fat.

00:52:48.675 --> 00:52:51.845
I said her clothes looked too small. I never said she looked fat.

00:52:53.645 --> 00:52:54.945
And you don't regret that?

00:52:55.145 --> 00:52:57.385
Being sad and feeling guilty are two different things.

00:52:57.445 --> 00:53:00.455
- Do you regret it or not? - And what good would that do?

00:53:02.615 --> 00:53:04.055
You should still regret it.

00:53:19.005 --> 00:53:21.235
Is this what you call "grieving in your own way?"

00:53:23.275 --> 00:53:25.205
Is it? You...

00:53:25.775 --> 00:53:27.845
You think we all had it rough because of Mom, don't you?

00:53:28.545 --> 00:53:30.045
But how are you any different from Mom?

00:53:30.545 --> 00:53:34.415
You both only think about yourselves and your pain. You're selfish too.

00:53:35.885 --> 00:53:36.885
But...

00:53:40.255 --> 00:53:42.425
at least Mom wasn't a coward like you.

00:53:55.875 --> 00:53:57.275
You just ran away.

00:53:58.645 --> 00:54:00.645
You didn't move out because you were making it on your own.

00:54:01.845 --> 00:54:03.545
You were running away from this family.

(Absolute Rest Required)

00:55:34.975 --> 00:55:36.035
Mom.

00:55:36.975 --> 00:55:38.145
We need to go to the hospital.

00:55:44.245 --> 00:55:46.715
- We should go to the hospital. - I'm not going.

00:55:48.115 --> 00:55:49.485
Aren't you going to do your physical therapy?

00:55:50.085 --> 00:55:52.325
How am I supposed to do therapy on a leg that isn't there?

00:55:56.725 --> 00:55:57.725
Fine.

00:55:59.095 --> 00:56:00.535
Even if you won't go to the hospital,

00:56:01.335 --> 00:56:03.305
you should at least wash your face and your hair.

00:56:04.465 --> 00:56:05.465
Okay?

00:56:06.705 --> 00:56:07.775
I don't want to.

00:56:12.145 --> 00:56:13.915
Are you just going to give up on life, Mom?

00:56:16.475 --> 00:56:18.145
You blame me for this, don't you?

00:56:18.645 --> 00:56:20.255
That you ended up like this because of me.

00:56:20.615 --> 00:56:22.855
So you're trying to destroy yourself just to spite me, is that it?

00:56:22.915 --> 00:56:24.884
- Get out. - That's why I told you not to come.

00:56:24.885 --> 00:56:26.555
- Get out. - I told you it was raining.

00:56:26.625 --> 00:56:29.795
- I said get out! - Why are you here driving me crazy?

00:56:29.865 --> 00:56:31.465
Get out!

00:56:45.875 --> 00:56:46.915
Hey, Jun Kyung.

00:56:50.845 --> 00:56:52.315
How can you just leave like this?

00:56:53.255 --> 00:56:55.585
Your mom's not in a good place. Fix things before you go.

00:56:58.725 --> 00:56:59.825
Maybe next time.

00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:01.125
Jun Kyung.

00:57:43.665 --> 00:57:45.605
I wanted to tell myself not to leave.

00:57:48.135 --> 00:57:49.405
To myself back then.

00:57:53.615 --> 00:57:55.045
I wanted to stop myself.

00:57:57.615 --> 00:57:58.715
To tell myself to stop.

00:58:02.555 --> 00:58:04.385
That if I ran away then,

00:58:07.655 --> 00:58:09.855
I would just keep running.

00:58:12.925 --> 00:58:14.365
Always pretending to be okay.

00:58:17.865 --> 00:58:19.305
Pretending that nothing was wrong.

00:58:22.575 --> 00:58:23.575
But again...

00:58:26.045 --> 00:58:27.045
and again.

00:58:30.745 --> 00:58:31.785
I...

00:58:33.215 --> 00:58:34.455
would end up lonely.

00:58:37.725 --> 00:58:39.455
I saw that. I was pretty thrown.

00:58:39.525 --> 00:58:40.954
- Hye Rin's manager... - Yes?

00:58:40.955 --> 00:58:42.855
Really treats Daniel like...

00:58:43.665 --> 00:58:45.565
- his beck and call. - Seriously?

00:58:45.625 --> 00:58:46.735
No, that's not it at all.

00:59:24.505 --> 00:59:27.205
- Hello? - Drinking by yourself again?

00:59:27.505 --> 00:59:30.705
We're opening some wild grape wine. Why don't you hurry over?

00:59:33.575 --> 00:59:34.575
That's right.

00:59:37.245 --> 00:59:39.915
I always did run away to your place, didn't I?

00:59:42.655 --> 00:59:43.655
What?

00:59:45.525 --> 00:59:46.925
Just like Hyung Jun said,

00:59:47.595 --> 00:59:49.995
I guess there's nothing I can do by myself.

00:59:51.995 --> 00:59:55.295
I can't fight, I can't make up,

00:59:56.695 --> 00:59:59.735
I can't comfort anyone, and I can't be comforted.

01:00:05.575 --> 01:00:07.115
The only thing I can do by myself...

01:00:08.215 --> 01:00:09.545
is being lonely.

01:00:14.055 --> 01:00:15.055
Jun Kyung.

01:00:15.555 --> 01:00:16.585
Do you want me to come over?

01:00:28.395 --> 01:00:29.395
No.

01:00:31.935 --> 01:00:33.005
I'm okay.

01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:38.675
Tonight, I'm okay.

01:00:50.455 --> 01:00:51.455
Jun Kyung.

01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:55.525
I'm sorry.

01:01:00.795 --> 01:01:02.965
No, it's...

01:01:06.405 --> 01:01:07.575
You...

01:01:08.305 --> 01:01:09.975
have nothing to be sorry about.

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:14.015
No, what I mean is...

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:24.085
It's just...

01:01:27.425 --> 01:01:28.495
You mean?

01:01:32.895 --> 01:01:34.465
I haven't been honest.

01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:48.045
I always lie and pretend I'm fine.

01:01:54.715 --> 01:01:55.815
So...

01:01:57.555 --> 01:01:58.555
what I'm trying to say is...

01:02:03.725 --> 01:02:05.495
I'd like to get to know you.

01:02:20.715 --> 01:02:21.815
But I thought...

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:27.885
you didn't want to get to know anyone.

01:02:33.455 --> 01:02:34.825
I'd like to try.

01:02:38.695 --> 01:02:40.295
If it's not too late.

01:02:49.075 --> 01:02:50.645
It is getting late.

01:02:56.315 --> 01:02:57.915
But it looks like there's still a chance.

01:03:13.425 --> 01:03:15.135
So, what should we do now?

01:03:21.735 --> 01:03:23.075
Let's take it slow.

01:03:26.645 --> 01:03:27.645
Okay.

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:29.415
Slowly.

01:03:38.325 --> 01:03:39.485
Want to come in for one minute?

01:03:47.095 --> 01:03:48.095
No.

01:03:49.935 --> 01:03:50.935
Slowly.

01:03:52.505 --> 01:03:53.535
Right.

01:03:55.475 --> 01:03:56.475
Slowly.

01:04:36.375 --> 01:04:39.845
I made single servings of bone broth and put them in the freezer.

01:04:40.185 --> 01:04:43.015
Make sure you eat well, and always lock the door.

01:04:49.155 --> 01:04:50.495
(Comments)

01:04:51.995 --> 01:04:54.035
Yoon Sol, you killed it today.

01:04:55.295 --> 01:04:56.395
Got a crush on me?

01:04:56.695 --> 01:04:57.905
"Got a crush on me?"

01:04:58.635 --> 01:05:00.975
- What? - It's Ju Hyeon Gyeong.

01:05:01.035 --> 01:05:03.335
- Okay. - It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:05:07.575 --> 01:05:08.615
Seo Jin Ho?

01:05:10.015 --> 01:05:11.245
Yes.

01:05:12.245 --> 01:05:14.985
Is Kim Mi Ran not coming with you?

01:05:17.185 --> 01:05:19.655
Something came up.

01:05:21.095 --> 01:05:22.395
Is it okay if I go by myself?

01:05:23.965 --> 01:05:24.995
Life...

01:05:27.835 --> 01:05:29.735
never lets a shining blessing...

01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:34.035
or an unbearable sorrow...

01:05:36.735 --> 01:05:39.675
linger by our side for long.

01:05:41.915 --> 01:05:43.575
More than that unbearable sorrow,

01:05:44.115 --> 01:05:46.245
- Where have I seen... - my deep rage that makes...

01:05:46.315 --> 01:05:48.484
- Right. - my heart pound is more important.

01:05:48.485 --> 01:05:51.055
- That's a first. - Pardon?

01:05:51.885 --> 01:05:54.055
You're the first person I've seen wear dress shoes on a trip.

01:05:54.595 --> 01:05:56.225
More than that unbearable sorrow,

01:05:59.065 --> 01:06:01.595
- You look sharp. - my own small, unexpected thrill...

01:06:01.665 --> 01:06:02.935
- is what's most important... - Grab your bags.

01:06:02.995 --> 01:06:05.265
- to us. - Please come this way.

01:06:05.335 --> 01:06:08.105
(Departures)

01:06:08.175 --> 01:06:10.035
A shining blessing,

01:06:13.605 --> 01:06:15.675
or an unbearable sorrow.

01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:22.285
Nothing...

01:06:23.785 --> 01:06:25.655
(Kim Mi Ran)

01:06:25.725 --> 01:06:27.055
is meant to stay...

01:06:30.025 --> 01:06:31.595
by our side for very long.

01:06:35.835 --> 01:06:40.435
(Love Me)

01:07:12.965 --> 01:07:13.974
- A birthday party? - Yes.

01:07:13.975 --> 01:07:16.375
How about my birthday party at your house?

01:07:17.275 --> 01:07:20.545
Is this what you call "grieving in our own way?"

01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:23.815
I'm a truly hopeless scumbag.

01:07:24.545 --> 01:07:27.515
I'm glad you came. I'm so glad you came.

01:07:27.955 --> 01:07:30.215
I feel like I'm the only one living well,

01:07:30.725 --> 01:07:33.425
and I feel so guilty and miserable about it.

01:07:34.195 --> 01:07:35.195
Seo Jin Ho.

01:07:35.825 --> 01:07:36.895
Seo Jin Ho?

01:07:37.155 --> 01:07:40.325
We agreed to take things slow, right?

01:07:41.435 --> 01:07:42.635
You like him that much?

01:07:43.065 --> 01:07:46.165
Just as I thought, being a couple complicates things.

01:07:47.165 --> 01:07:49.805
You're not getting disappointed as you learn more about me, are you?

01:07:49.875 --> 01:07:52.875
Why did I ever like you? Why did I trust someone like you?

01:07:52.975 --> 01:07:54.445
The regret is driving me crazy.
