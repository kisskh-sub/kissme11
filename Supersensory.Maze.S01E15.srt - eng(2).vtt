00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.310
My name is Wu Haoxue.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.600
Jiang Yue,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.040
please cooperate

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.950
with our investigation.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.400
Jiang Yue

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.760
is a name Hou Liangyuan picked.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.200
It's to please him.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.680
Haoxue

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.790
means white snow.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.840
What a nice name.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.710
He's never getting out, is he?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.200
Jiang Yongquan

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.680
is never getting out, is he?

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.640
Help us rescue

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.310
the women who were trafficked

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.430
and find more evidence

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.590
so the law can punish men like him.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.030
Fengyang County.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.520
Jiujin County.

Dayi Village.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.360
How many women did you traffic

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.630
to these places?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.280
Among all the suspects

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.630
of the "8·19" trafficking case,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.150
only one is still at large.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.680
If it weren't for me,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.150
you'd still be

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.190
Jiang Yongquan.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.840
All I know is

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.280
he's the boss of the crowd.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.080
Skinny, about 1.7 m.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.430
Everyone calls him Jiang.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.120
A trafficker sold me

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.470
to Lu Youcheng's house

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.360
in Lujia Village.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.750
He has a younger brother,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.960
Lu Youliang.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.280
Lu Youcheng's wife is Wu Min;

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.310
their son is Lu Ran.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.840
Stay calm.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.030
Calm down.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.080
Lu Ran believes

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.960
Stay calm.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.470
his whole tragedy

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.750
started with Wu Min's abduction.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.750
Everything he's done

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.000
is to make

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.910
every member

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.270
of that trafficking ring pay.

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.240
I'm sure

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.040
you won't be the last one.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.360
With the evidence we now have,

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.160
we'll charge you with abduction,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.750
kidnapping and extortion,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.120
illegal detention,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.830
intentional assault, and murder.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.110
Who did I kill?

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.030
Show me the proof.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.870
You killed your cousin Hou Liangyuan.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.070
I'm right here.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.480
You ate yourself into this shape.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.040
Every day, you were terrified

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.510
of turning back
into the wanted Jiang Yongquan.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.630
I've seen plenty of kids.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.120
Timid,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.960
clever,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.320
and hot-headed.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.510
They go from defiant to obedient.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.240
No big difference.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680
I can tell

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.190
that you landed on your feet.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.680
Back then,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.750
I should've sold you

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.040
to a theft ring.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.830
Time will not reverse.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.360
Nothing suspicious here.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.950
Do you have a camera at the gate?

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.880
Yes.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.960
Freeze.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.710
Don't move!

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.390
Stay down.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.230
Cuff him.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.200
We traced

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.630
every entry in the ledger.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.150
Most of the money,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.080
though routed through varied companies

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.840
and passed through several hands,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.910
was finally invested in artworks.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.910
Those pieces

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.910
were all exported

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.440
and auctioned overseas

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.480
via Liang Xinyue's firm.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.160
Stranger still,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.820
(Auctioned Artworks)
the latest shipment

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.360
originally scheduled for next week

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.030
was suddenly rushed out

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.550
last night.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.750
Wang,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.150
call customs right now

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.030
and block export channels
of those goods.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.220
You check recent flights

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.200
and any out-of-province

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.550
or overseas travel

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.440
for Mai Boyuan, Zhao Xin,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.550
Liang Xinyue,

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.000
and Zhuang Mingcheng.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.840
We'll start at 5 million.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.440
- 6 million.
- Sure.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.480
6 million

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.630
from Bidder 51.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.470
8 million.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.910
8 million.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.360
8 million

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.790
from Bidder 49.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:37.670
10 million.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.960
10 million.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.510
10 million

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.960
from Bidder 52.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.150
Any higher, everyone?

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.120
I don't have time

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.200
for your games.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.750
Tell me where He Ya is now.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:48.590
Going twice

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.870
at 10 million.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.870
What's the rush?

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.900
We both suffered in Lujia Village.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.750
- Sold!
- The head

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.990
of the trafficking ring is here.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.030
All of them are rich and powerful.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.630
- It's unfair, isn't it?
- Next one.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.200
Should I thank you

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.000
for counting me as one of your kind?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.960
I forgot to tell you:

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.720
He Ya's life is on a countdown.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.060
(Starting bid)

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.900
Sold.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.740
Lu Ran,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.080
do you know why

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.600
I've listened to you this long?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.750
I'd love to know what chip

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.080
could buy me.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.240
You've always wanted to know

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.080
why you were born into that family.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.240
Fine.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240
Next one, please.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.240
Hou Liangyuan is

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.080
Jiang Yongquan.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.160
Sold.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.080
Mr. Xu,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.080
you don't think

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.120
useless info like that

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.030
is trade-worthy, do you?

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.910
Your hatred

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.320
needs a clear target.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.060
If you'd told me sooner,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.480
maybe it'd be a chip.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.960
But he's been arrested.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.750
What would you do if I had told you?

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.560
Would you kill him?

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.000
Yes.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.270
You already suspected

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.270
I'd taken lives;

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.390
you just couldn't face it.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.480
You chose blindness.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.630
I chose you.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.750
Time's up.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:13.840
Here's the truth you chose.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.040
Excuse me.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.510
This is the result you wanted.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.670
Which one do you want?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.470
I want the result.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.670
Where's your cool head?

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.910
Your reason?

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.910
Emotion solves nothing.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.150
You taught me that.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.550
I'm not the one who flips the board,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.550
and I don't want it to be you.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.360
I've never been

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.270
in the cage.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.480
You chose your truth,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.600
so you should pay for that.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.030
I'll ask once more:

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.480
Where's He Ya?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.270
Lane E-03, Logistics Warehouse,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.150
No. 118 Guangli Road.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.200
You have 57 minutes left.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.510
Sir, please behave.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.240
Sir, are you alright?

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.030
Why isn't Ms. Zhao here?

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.670
She asked me to pick you up first.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.840
Okay.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.750
Zhao Xin has had him

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.120
picked up.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.000
Follow them.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.440
I want to see his corpse.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.320
Yes.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.870
What are you doing?

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.120
15 minutes are left.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.080
13...

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.840
10...

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.910
Anyone there?

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.600
Open the door!

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.120
Anyone there?

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:07.790
Anyone there?

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.680
Open the door!

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.110
He Ya!

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.830
He Ya!

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.720
You're too late.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.520
Yuan,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.440
is this how you

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.270
experience pain?

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.100
(Wuyang Police Big-Data Platform)

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.150
Director Feng,

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.440
Xu Jingzhi is rushing

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.400
to No. 118 Guangli Road

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.240
to find Captain He.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.880
He says Mai Boyuan may be in danger.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.030
Surveillance shows

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.240
he left the auction

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.160
and never returned.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.600
Cams nearby and along the road

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.400
are being checked.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.270
His photo

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.550
has been sent to all departments.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.960
Where's Yin Wei?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.790
They're on their way.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.880
About 90 minutes

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.270
to the warehouse.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.790
Tell them to be fast.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.160
Make sure He Ya is safe.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.350
He Ya!

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.720
He Ya?

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.150
He Ya!

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.350
Soon,

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:00.400
you'll feel

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.640
what I felt.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.920
You'll be free.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.720
Yin Wei,

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.330
I'm at No. 118 Logistics Warehouse,

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.200
Guangli Road.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.790
I've found Comrade He Ya

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.070
in Cold Warehouse III.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.790
Yes.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.720
Aren't you just me?

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.110
What are you afraid of?

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.270
Don't be afraid.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.880
I'll take you home.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.400
Xu Jingzhi, wake up.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.240
Xu Jingzhi!

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.390
Yuan,

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.310
don't you want to save me?

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.830
Why do you want to arrest me now?

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.790
When a person drowns

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.160
in their own state,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.160
this is what happens.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.510
Let go!

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.240
I'm not sick!

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.590
- What's wrong?
- I'm fine!

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.430
Get him out.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.920
I said I'm fine!

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:14.630
Yuan,

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.110
this isn't who you are.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.920
I had a nightmare again.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.550
I'm here; don't worry.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.160
That's a dummy.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.550
Are you looking for this?

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.640
Mr. Mai sent me...

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.030
I'll call him, then.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.560
Zhao Xin,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.750
you hid deep.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.310
You had someone

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.550
hit me with a car, right?

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.830
It's just for this list?

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.160
If I hadn't been lucky...

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.240
Without me,

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.160
you'd have died 18 years ago.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.960
What do you mean?

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.110
You know what I mean.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.750
You can pretend

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.000
that night never happened.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.920
But for me,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.000
it's always been vivid in my mind.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:53.790
In every sleepless night,

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.510
in every stranger's bed,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.830
I'd think

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.000
of that day.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.200
If I hadn't tried to save you,

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.830
I wouldn't have missed

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:09.960
the last bus,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.920
nor would I have been abducted
by Hou Liangyuan

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.200
and sold to Mai Boyuan.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.640
Nor would I have been standing here

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.480
to bear

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.290
your sneer and threat.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.520
A glass.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.110
I can't drink.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.920
I really can't.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.920
Be gentle.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.280
Yes.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.680
You're so lucky.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.790
Good family.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.560
Noble,

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.200
spotless,

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.830
and respectable.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.480
What about me?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.840
I'm a whore,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.350
a lowlife.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680
Stop.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.200
Why not wear the blue one?

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.440
The blue from last time

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.350
suited you.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.610
It was custom-made for you.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.030
You don't like this?

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.110
This style isn't you.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.240
I mean this dress;

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.920
it's for little girls.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.270
I still prefer your old look.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.750
It's more seductive and charming.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.240
No wonder you despise me;

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.160
I despise myself.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.790
But

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.200
who turned me

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.310
into what I am today?

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.070
Stop.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.310
You can't take it?

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.640
It's you!

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.920
Stop!

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.440
What have you done all these years?

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.410
You've been helping Hou Liangyuan

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.920
and Mai Boyuan.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.960
How could you face me?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.790
How could you face the girls at school?

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:16.870
Who are you?

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.920
Who are you people?

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.160
What do you want?

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.030
Did someone hire you?

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.480
I'll pay double.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.790
Name your price.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.000
How can you not know me?

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.000
I've done

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
so much for you,

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.480
Mr. Mai.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.070
You're Zhi Fei?

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.720
All these years,

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:00.270
I've never blamed you.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.590
Funny.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.480
If it

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.030
happened again,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.480
I'd still save you.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.960
But my life

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.200
is already ruined.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.680
Now, finally, there's a chance

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.350
to start over.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.200
I don't want anything else.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.350
I just want to live a normal life.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.310
I beg you.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720
Please help me.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.790
Just this once, please.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:00.400
Okay?

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.350
Sorry.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.910
Thank you.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.880
For our safety,

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.680
I couldn't contact you directly.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.550
I hope there's no misunderstanding

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.980
between us.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.960
I have substantial assets abroad

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.000
that need managing.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:57.550
I want you to work for me.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.030
You can be direct.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.550
Tell me how much you want.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.960
There's no misunderstanding

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.920
or personal grudge.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.550
Kidnapping you wasn't my idea.

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.960
I only promised to hand you over to her.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.840
Why don't you two

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:19.840
talk it out?

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:23.950
Young lady,

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.810
I can give you
everything I promised him.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.230
I can give you money.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.230
Name your price.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.590
I have many assets...

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.230
He's sincere.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.880
You can talk to him.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.000
I've heard enough

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.030
of men's lies.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.400
I tried for you.

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.550
She won't budge.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.440
It's up to you now.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.840
What's the plan

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:30.030
for your mess?

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.030
No rush.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:35.630
Let's watch the show first.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.840
All of you have someone

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.630
you'd die for.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.160
So?

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:45.630
What do you want?

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.070
Whether Xu Jingzhi

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.400
is truly cold

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.070
or just repressed,

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.070
what you're doing now...

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.960
He Ya is
the most important person to him.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.960
So what?

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.400
I just want a result.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.460
(Inpatient Department)

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.440
Keep the wound dry.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:19.840
No strenuous exercise.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.840
- Got it.
- Thanks, doctor.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.720
Thanks.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.060
You still won't tell me

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.170
how you escaped

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.110
from the cold warehouse?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.630
If I ever face

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.110
a life-or-death moment like that,

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:43.510
what do I do?

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.760
Educate me.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.030
Qin has done that.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.320
Who?

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:53.400
Remember

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.280
the auto-shop case?

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.320
I don't want Qin's lecture;

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.320
I want yours.

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.320
Oxygen bottles hold pressure

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:06.400
far higher than outside.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.280
They explode

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.440
under strong impact

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.320
or heat.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.030
Outside space,

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.800
oxygen content,

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.230
and pressure differential are the key.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.230
Even if your math's perfect,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.360
you can't predict

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.440
which way

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:23.710
the shrapnel flies.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:30.920
What are you trying to say?

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.880
If it were you,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.840
what would you do?

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.880
If it were me,

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.760
I'd trust you to accept

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.880
my decision.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.190
But it's you now.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.070
I don't know how to accept it.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.360
Without you,

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.320
I'd be lost.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.320
I love you, He Ya.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.800
I love you.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.400
Here they are.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.510
Xiaoli! Xiaoli!

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.760
Xiaoli!

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.830
I just finished the paperwork
at the bureau.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:34.800
From this moment,

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800
I'm back on the team.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.360
Still, under your command.
