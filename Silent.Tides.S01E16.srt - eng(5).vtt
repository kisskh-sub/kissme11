00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.990
[Episode 16]

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.039
How did you leak
the banknote serial numbers?

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.700
In this HKD War,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.900
who was the one
organizing the Chinese merchants?

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.040
And how did you

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.070
get in contact with that person?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.510
Wake him up and continue the torture.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.310
Yes, Sir!

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.690
Alright.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.110
That's enough

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.810
for today.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.730
I just don't understand

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.910
why you're so certain

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.470
that it wasn't the HSBC treasurer

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.970
but Qiao Renyu
who leaked the banknote serial numbers?

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.690
Besides,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.480
he had been under

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.140
your close surveillance.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.290
How could he have managed to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.640
pass intelligence?

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.810
And who was

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.420
his contact?

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.880
As for how he passed information,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.570
I truly can't figure it out right now.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.190
But

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.380
as for his contact,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.230
I do have a suspect.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.600
Who?

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.600
He Xian.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.850
He Xian?

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.140
Yes.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.810
Here is

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.070
his basic information.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.970
Based on this information,

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.350
he's just an ordinary merchant.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.070
As the chief of
the Macau Intelligence Agency,

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.130
your attention

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.040
should be focused on

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.140
those higher-ups,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.540
not these small players.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.010
Excuse me.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.690
What is it?

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.760
General, the new currency samples
have arrived.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.970
Let me see.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.430
Gentlemen,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.280
after the vote
by the board representatives

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.640
of Banco Nacional Ultramarino,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.770
it was unanimously approved

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.100
and submitted to
the General Economic Bureau for approval.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.310
Now,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.610
on behalf of the board, I'd like to
officially announce

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.640
the appointment

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.750
of Mr. He Xian

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.270
as the first Chinese business manager

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.700
of our Macau Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.250
Mr. He, we look forward to
working with you.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.360
I am deeply honored by the board's trust

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.720
[BNU Chinese Business Manager, He Xian]

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.980
and will faithfully carry out my duties.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.160
Our sincere congratulations.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.690
Still no good.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.880
General.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.820
You can tell it's fake

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.190
as soon as you touch it.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.510
It seems even the HSBC printing factory

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.600
isn't up to the task either.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.340
Execute the chief printer

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.140
in front of the entire printing team.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.610
And then tell the remaining British staff

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.520
that if they can't produce

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.690
qualified Customs Gold Units
within a month,

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.690
they'll all be executed.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.930
Yes, Sir!

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.260
General,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.990
the Chinese government's
Customs Gold Units

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.760
use special British Pound printing plates.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.640
The security level is so high

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.740
that ordinary paper
cannot substitute for it.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.200
Without the British Pound printing plates,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.460
no matter how much we pressure
those printers,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.220
I'm afraid it still won't work.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.810
Of course I know the key issue
is the printing plate.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.720
But

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.430
we've searched all the banks
and printing factories

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.070
and found no stock to confiscate.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.720
What else can we do
besides forcing them to find a solution?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.260
What do you think?

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.430
War ultimately

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.260
comes down to

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.140
financial power and resource supply.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.570
Although this HKD War

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.110
was lost disastrously
due to Ogata's arrogance

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.110
and foolishness,

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.380
our Imperial Army
is about to abolish the HKD.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.220
By then,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.310
we'll be able to fully control

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.310
Macau's finances and even trade.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.840
Sawa,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.690
this will be your primary focus
moving forward.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.840
Do you understand?

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.070
Yes, Sir!

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.940
Looks pretty good.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.520
Chang.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.710
Compile statistics on Japanese aircraft

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.460
takeoff and landing movements.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.950
Fatty Qiang, keep monitoring.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.810
Yes, Chang.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.480
A hog bristle dealer?

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.640
Lyun Coeng received a merchant
from Zhongshan.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.670
His surname is Zhang. Quite impressive.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.760
Saito even personally welcomed him.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.190
I went through a lot of effort to find out

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.920
that he's a hog bristle seller.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.810
Alright, now,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.010
drop everything else

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.870
and just focus on this Zhang guy.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.870
Keep a close watch on him
and figure out his movements.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.640
What's the deal with
this hog bristle seller?

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.570
Is he important?

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.510
Do you know what cannons,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.310
aircrafts, and tanks

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.610
fear the most?

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:31.760
What?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.000
Rust.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.840
Especially warships.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.570
Sea breeze and seawater
are highly corrosive.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.429
So every month,

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.220
warships need to be painted
with anti-rust paint inside and out.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.929
And the brushes for applying
anti-rust paint

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.060
are all disposable.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.070
What does that have to do
with hog bristles?

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.070
As for the brushes used for
applying anti-rust paint,

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.000
the best material for the bristles

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.450
is hog bristle

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.070
from Chinese native hogs.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.150
No wonder the Japanese go to such lengths

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.280
to buy hog bristles.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.460
Actually, China has many
strategic supplies

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.120
that are of great importance.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.510
The countries at war

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.450
are all desperate to get them.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.810
That's why

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.310
these things

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.490
are crucial intelligence.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.100
I understand, Chang.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.930
I'll find out this traitor's movements.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.570
Alright.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.930
The next item.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.690
January.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.960
Owe to intelligence officer Yang Chang

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.580
95 Hong Kong dollars.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.720
Owe to trainee officer Xiao Feng

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.960
50 Hong Kong dollars.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.430
No superiors, no funds.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.840
Can't even pay
the intelligence officers' salaries.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.770
An intelligence station like ours

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.240
might as well be blown up.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.840
Only a fool like you

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.950
would still take this service station
seriously.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:05.790
Xian.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.480
Fortunately, I withdrew from
the stabilization operation in time

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.410
and avoided losses for Lyun Coeng.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.050
Saito wants to promote me
to shipping manager.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.290
But...

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.820
Isn't a promotion a good thing?

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.910
Why the long face?

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.550
My fiancée is firmly against it now.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.540
She won't let me take on this job.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.150
Understandable.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.910
These days, whose eyes

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.700
aren't fixed on the cargo ships
carrying supplies?

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.030
And is there even a day when something
doesn't go wrong a few times?

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.460
If you take
this shipping manager position,

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.060
you'll have to escort ships.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.120
How could any girl

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.080
accept her fiancé

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.620
doing such a life-threatening job?

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.220
If that were all,

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.150
I wouldn't have come to you
specifically, Xian,

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.550
to vent my frustrations.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.740
What else is there?

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.960
Actually, what I really can't get past

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.420
is how to convince myself.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.670
What kind of business Lyun Coeng is doing,

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:54.950
and who those overpriced supplies

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.210
are being provided to—

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.880
others might not know,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.480
but surely you're aware of that.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.240
Before, I was just a minor secretary.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.530
I could claim ignorance,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.360
that I was just trying to
make a living.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.240
But if I become the shipping manager,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.200
with shipments after shipments
going out under my watch,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.030
can I keep deceiving myself?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.200
I know

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.980
that as a poor guy wanting to
start a family,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.910
I need to make something of myself.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.120
I also know that if I don't take it,

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.320
plenty of others will jump at the chance,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.850
and Lyun Coeng won't lose
a penny of business.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.160
I'm just worried...

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.450
Worried

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.120
about what others will think of you?

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.170
Xian,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:32.980
tell me,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.270
should I take
this shipping manager position?

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.740
Hongshen,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.400
as for this question,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.770
I can't give you an answer right now.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.170
Actually, I know

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.280
some choices can only be made
by myself in the end.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.840
It's just it's been bothering me,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.270
so I couldn't help
but want to talk to you, Xian.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.450
Just pretend

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.200
that I never said anything.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.780
I know you're feeling upset right now,

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.530
but you still need to eat something.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.200
Besides, you're still sick.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.220
Don't worry.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:28.220
I've

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.550
had my friends in Hong Kong
to look into it.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.220
I'll let you know as soon as

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.160
there's any news of Mr. Qiao.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.360
I'll go get you some hot water.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.740
Mr. He.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.430
Yu.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.980
How has Miss Qiao been these days?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.670
She's been taking sick leave.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.470
Even when I went to see her,
she wouldn't say a word.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.270
Yu.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.770
Please give these to Miss Qiao for me.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.650
Mr. He.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.500
Aren't you coming in?

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.550
I'm not.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.430
Thank you.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.030
What are you doing here?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.320
I heard Yinwan is sick,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.960
so...

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.720
After what you did to his brother,

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.090
now you show up acting like a good guy?

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.340
Are you worried she's not sick enough

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.980
and want to push her even harder?

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.930
Mr. Lok Pak.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.420
I really just wanted to...

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.460
Leave.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.500
Yinwan.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.310
Dr. Lok, you can have this.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.380
I'm really fine.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:55.890
[Dorm 1]

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.550
Thank you.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.580
Yinwan.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:08.570
Sister-in...

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.620
Mrs. He.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.000
Yinwan.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.380
I came to see you.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.080
Yinwan.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.310
I know what happened

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.500
to your brother.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.690
This matter is Xian's fault.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.520
I understand you don't want to
see him now.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.460
I'm here

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.810
to apologize to you on his behalf.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.310
These days,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.840
Xian has spared no effort,

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.500
trying every possible way to
get information about your brother.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.750
In all our years of marriage,

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.050
I've never seen him like this.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.310
If there had been any other way,

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.500
I believe he would never have hurt you.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.930
I know

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.220
the pain you've suffered

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.220
can't be fixed with just a few words.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.430
And I don't expect you to forgive Xian
right away.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.550
I just hope

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.900
you can give him a chance to make amends.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:04.890
Even if

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.220
you want to yell at him
or hit him to vent your anger,

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.480
it would be better than

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.589
you two never speaking to
each other again.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:12.520
Don't you think?

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.420
Can you give him a chance?

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.390
Mrs. He.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.420
You're being too formal.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.880
Actually, deep down, I understand

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.950
that he did that for Macau

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.020
and for the Resistance.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.700
He didn't do anything wrong.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.340
And I don't need...

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.130
I don't need him to apologize to me.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.630
I also...

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.700
I also have no right to

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:48.620
expect an apology from him.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.430
I just...

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:57.800
I'm sorry.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.850
I'm still not feeling well.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.850
I'll be going now.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.020
Xian brought gifts again?

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.620
Yeah. I don't even know
how we should thank him.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.770
Chang!

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.620
Who's that?

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.230
Morning.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.960
Morning.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.890
It's you, Master Huang.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.500
Mary.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.000
What brings you here?

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.630
So it's actually
three joys coming your way?

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.740
You struck it rich, Chang?

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.390
No.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:32.890
Xian brought us these.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:34.850
Xian knows I'm too embarrassed
to borrow money from him,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:35.350
so every time he forces money on me

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.460
under the guise of giving me gifts.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.090
This little service station of ours

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.020
has been completely funded by him.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.430
As expected from Xian.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.150
Helping whenever he can
is his principle.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.540
Don't worry. When you make it big
in the future,

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.670
you can pay him back.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:48.490
By the way,

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.260
you said "three joys coming our way."

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.390
What does that mean?

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.960
Look,

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.500
the first joy is that

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.930
you've got money now.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.690
As for the second joy,

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.520
remember that hog bristle dealer

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.380
you were investigating earlier?

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.450
He just reached Gongbei

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.700
and hadn't even made it to town

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.500
when Commander Ou executed him.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.430
Did you hear that?

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.090
Another traitor eliminated.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.830
Announcements about eliminating traitors
are all over Zhongshan County.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.410
Those smugglers recruited by Lyun Coeng

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.090
are all hiding like turtles now.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.220
That's great news.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.280
What about the third joy?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.910
The third joy

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.350
could be considered fallen from the sky.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.540
What is it? Tell us.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.960
Hey, don't keep us in suspense.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.020
Alright, alright.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.280
Take a good look.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.150
What is this?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.610
What does this mean?

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.850
You want me to read this to you?

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.740
Commander Ou specially

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.130
entrusted our Tai Ho Brotherhood

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.170
to bring this from Zhongshan for you.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.370
It's very important.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.150
Commander Ou?

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:50.740
Mary,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.800
remember your cousin Colonel Lyons?

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.260
After his escape,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.760
he reported his rescue experience
to the British Army.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.390
The Allied Force Headquarters

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.350
specially sent an intelligence officer,

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.090
who established contact with
the Black Hill Guerrilla Unit.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.150
They learned that your service station
not only exists

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.000
but has also been
consistently operational.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.540
Therefore,

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.220
the Allied Forces' China Theater
and Pacific Theater

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.550
have jointly confirmed

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.040
that your station is
the designated intelligence post

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.000
for the Allied Forces on the Macau front.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.410
That's why this book
has been awarded to you.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.470
It's the exclusive cipher book
for your radio station.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.850
It's payday!

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.540
-Yeah!
-Double the pay!

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.510
I bought you some sweet soup.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.040
You were so excited that you didn't eat.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:44.450
You must be hungry.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.040
Hmm.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.200
What are you writing?

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.460
You seem very focused.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.800
A telegraph tutorial.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.040
Now that we have the cipher codes,

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.280
you need to learn
how to send telegrams.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.210
Me learning how to send telegrams?

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.410
But we don't even have
a telegraph machine.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:01.390
We don't now,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.350
but we will in the future.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.350
I don't need to learn.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.010
It's enough that you know how.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.060
Won't our intelligence station
continue to expand?

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.280
When we have more staff in the future

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.350
and work gets busier,

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.700
relying on me alone to send telegrams

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.830
may not suffice.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.120
That's why I'm working on
this simple tutorial.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.480
With this,

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.480
you can learn how to send telegrams.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:27.700
I can learn it just with this?

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.060
Yes.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.690
The telegraph technology is based on
Morse code.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.110
Hmm.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:32.100
Once you master Morse code

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.480
and combine it with this cipher book,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.170
you'll be able to send encrypted messages.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:37.830
Do you know what Morse code is?

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.280
I've heard of it.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.960
It's very simple.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.480
Come on,

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:41.950
sit here.

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:44.200
What for?

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.890
I'll teach you how to send telegrams.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:47.040
Right now?

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.780
Forget it.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.780
Sit.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:54.830
Alright.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.480
Let's pretend this is the key
of the telegraph machine.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.150
Short beep—

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.450
pressing once makes a dot.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.170
Long beep—

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.740
holding for 3 times
the length of a dot makes a dash.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.100
I'll give you instructions,
and you try it.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.900
Short beep.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.830
Short beep. Short beep.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:12.520
That's right.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.630
Long beep.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.220
Wanqi.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.820
I've noticed your cough is getting worse.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.960
No matter how busy you are with work,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.290
you still need to
take care of your health.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.110
If it doesn't improve, you should
go see Mr. Ke for a checkup.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.690
It'll give you peace of mind.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:33.500
It's nothing.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.350
Mrs. He, with so many rings,

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.810
which one should I choose?

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.220
You're usually quiet,

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.540
but when it comes to
picking an engagement ring,

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.870
you're really putting your heart into it.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:51.750
How about this one?

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:52.960
It's very beautiful.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.220
Baixin will love it.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.800
This one looks nice.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.040
With your taste, Mrs. He,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.840
Baixin will definitely like it.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.700
Excuse me,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.760
I'll take this one.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.910
This ring needs to be custom-made.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.420
The price is 880 pataca.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.300
Okay.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.820
Sir, please write down the ring size.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.040
880 pataca.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.830
Sir, we don't accept HKD here.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.220
But HKD has always been accepted in Macau.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.650
How could you have such a rule?

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.540
The newspaper just released
a special edition,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.220
saying that the Japanese Army
has announced the abolition of HKD

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.150
and its replacement with
Japanese military currency.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.090
I'm sorry, Sir.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.410
My visit this time

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.700
is to convey to the Macau government
an official notice from

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.670
Governor Isogai Rensuke
and the Japanese Imperial Army's

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.960
Southern China Command:

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.100
effective immediately,
in all Japanese-controlled areas,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.410
anyone carrying or using HKD

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.740
will be considered an economic criminal.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.520
All the HKD they carry
will be confiscated,

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.120
and offenders will be executed
without trial.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.650
But...

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.410
HKD is also in circulation in Macau.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.410
You didn't even give us any heads-up

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.720
before suddenly announcing its abolition.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.980
Aren't you forcing Macau into a dead end?

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.190
What kind of talk is that?

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.780
Japan is only abolishing HKD

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.150
in areas under our control.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.370
If Macau still wants to use it,

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.030
feel free to do so internally.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.950
The Empire of Japan

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.810
has not interfered with
Macau's internal affairs.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.410
But you know perfectly well

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:36.410
that Macau

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.780
depends entirely on

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.440
trade with the surrounding regions
to survive.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.320
Your announcement of abolition

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.630
is essentially

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.560
cutting off all Macau's trade lifelines!

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.820
Isn't that forcing Macau into a dead end?

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.350
Mr. Lok Pak, please don't be so agitated.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.090
Our Empire of Japan

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.850
is not without compassion.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.150
To be frank,

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.630
Governor Isogai
knows that abolishing HKD

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.150
will inevitably affect Macau's economy
and the people's livelihood,

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.950
so he has already come up with
a solution for Macau.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.000
He would like to offer your government

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.520
a friendly suggestion:

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:09.700
Macau

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:12.170
could consider
following Hong Kong's example

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.760
and adopting
Japanese military currency

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.350
as your fiat currency.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.450
As long as your government
accepts this suggestion,

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.020
Hong Kong and the Japanese Imperial Army

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.280
will provide all necessary assistance.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.410
You...

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.830
This is pure extortion!

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.780
I said it's a friendly suggestion.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.910
Besides,

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.520
does Macau have any other options now?

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:47.670
Military currency?

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.630
The Japanese can print
as much of this stuff as they want.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.190
It's worth even less than toilet paper.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.850
If we use it,

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:53.560
we might as well let the Japanese

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.260
come and rob Macau directly.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.180
The government understands the logic.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.170
But Macau is big and significant—

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.130
without its own currency,

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.520
it would be like returning to
prehistoric times.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.330
Indeed.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.370
If we can't find an alternative to HKD,

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.870
even if the government
doesn't want to use military currency,

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.400
we may have no other choice.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.760
I thought before abolishing HKD,

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.390
the Japanese would at least issue a notice

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.120
to give us some buffer time.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.870
I didn't expect them to act so fast.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.700
They're really trying to strangle Macau.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.540
I remember

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.020
BNU once tried issuing Macau pataca.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.460
Why not simply introduce Macau pataca,

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.590
letting Macau have its own currency
from now on?

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.670
This approach

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.540
has been considered
by GEB and BNU

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.670
long ago,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.260
but it's actually not feasible.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.330
Why not?

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.480
Because Portugal simply doesn't
produce printing plates.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.520
Previously, when we tried to
issue Macau pataca,

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.130
it was printed in Britain

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.330
and shipped back to Macau.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.800
But HKD is already
deeply entrenched in Macau.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.110
The Macau pataca couldn't
break into the market at all.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.830
So the government and BNU

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.350
abandoned their plans
to print our own money.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.780
Without printing plates,

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.380
how can they issue currency?

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.110
If we don't have printing plates,

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.480
we can buy them from abroad.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:12.910
That was possible before,

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:13.950
but not anymore.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.550
Since the war broke out,

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.060
to prevent enemies from
counterfeiting their currency

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.520
and disrupting their financial systems,

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.610
all countries capable of
producing printing plates

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:23.980
have placed their printing plates

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.180
under the strictest military control.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.060
All exports are prohibited.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.860
Seems like this approach won't work.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.430
Printing plates...

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:47.220
Xian,

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.880
what kind of printing plate is used
to print HKD?

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.200
Is it something called

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.780
D...

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.950
D E L...

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:54.350
De La Rue?

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.950
The De La Rue printing plate?

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:56.800
That's right.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.770
Why are you asking about this?

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.350
I've seen
this kind of printing plate before.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.500
Two full trucks of them at HSBC.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:04.960
When?

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.700
Where?

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:13.890
Miss Qiao.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.300
Yinwan, we have something very important

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.900
that we need to ask you about.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.020
That is to say,

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.330
on the day Hong Kong fell,

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.780
your brother mentioned

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.780
that there were two financial "bombs"
hidden in HSBC.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.000
In order to relocate one of them,

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.720
it took some extra time.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.660
Two financial "bombs".

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.850
One must be

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.480
the over 100 million HKD
that haven't been issued.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.890
Before they could deal with
the over 100 million HKD,

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.720
HSBC sought naval assistance

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.460
to transfer something else onto a warship.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.960
That clearly shows

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.200
those items

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.460
were much more important than those HKD.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.720
And this batch of items

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.040
were the printing plates Chang saw.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:58.360
It all adds up.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.410
But if, according to what Chang said,

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.060
due to Japanese bombing,

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.190
those printing plates

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.110
failed to be transferred onto the warship,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.130
then whether Mr. Qiao

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.110
hid the printing plates

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.110
or destroyed them

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.990
would be hard for us to determine.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.060
Chang,

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.900
when did the bombing occur?

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.500
Around 5 PM.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:19.930
Yinwan,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:21.540
when you arrived at HSBC

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.280
and saw it was under Japanese control,

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.250
what time was it?

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.780
Around 8 PM.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.110
You mentioned

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.910
that your brother

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.740
called home once during that time.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.070
What exactly did he say?

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.820
He said there was an unexpected situation,

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.590
and he needed to stay

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.200
to arrange the transfer of
some important bank assets.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.300
He told me to leave first.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.040
Are you sure he said "transfer"

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.760
instead of "destroy" or something else?

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.690
That was the last phone call
between my brother and me.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.700
I remember every word he said.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.100
There's no chance it's mistaken.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.590
So that means

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.920
Mr. Qiao only had 3 hours

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.740
to handle this batch of printing plates,

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.220
including travel time from
the naval port to a place,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.110
and then from that place

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.170
back to HSBC—two separate journeys.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.540
With such a large batch of
special printing plates,

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.350
it would be impossible to
destroy them all within 3 hours

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.950
without drawing attention.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:13.720
Therefore,

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.220
he must have hidden them

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.850
in some secret location,

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.220
and that secret location

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.480
is on Hong Kong Island.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.260
But if this batch of printing plates

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.590
was really hidden away,

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.850
then why didn't Mr. Qiao

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:27.960
share this secret with you last time

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.360
when he passed on the serial numbers
to you?

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:34.810
This actually proves

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.960
that this batch of printing plates
is currently safe.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.910
The Japanese are not yet
aware of its existence.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.170
That's why he didn't dare take any risks,

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:43.590
preferring to keep this secret

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.880
to himself.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.650
This also proves

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.320
that Mr. Qiao believed

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.690
if this batch of printing plates
fell into the enemy's hands,

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.090
the damage it could cause

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.760
would be 10 or even 100 times worse

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.820
than that caused by

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.370
120 million HKD.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.240
10 or even 100 times worse

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.240
than that caused by 120 million HKD?

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:05.990
What could that be?

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.320
There's only one possibility.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.260
The Customs Gold Units.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.000
The Customs Gold Units?

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.740
The Customs Gold Units are printed on

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.650
De La Rue Company's
special printing plates,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.450
the exact same kind used for
HKD and British Pound.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.980
If this batch of printing plates

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.840
were to fall into Japanese hands,

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.260
the Customs Gold Units—the only instrument

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:29.020
representing China's gold reserves

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.980
and currently China's sole means
of international payment—

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.510
would face
a massive counterfeiting crisis.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.130
Mr. Qiao did everything possible

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.410
to protect this secret

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.150
precisely because he knew

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.060
the Japanese would use this

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.060
to destroy our last remaining
financial foundation in one stroke.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.760
Now our mission is clear:

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.760
only by finding
this batch of printing plates

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.620
can Macao be brought back to life.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.910
And there are likely only two people
who know about this—

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:52.000
one is Qiao Renyu,

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.750
and the other is William,
who was responsible for the escort.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.170
That's right.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.550
Mr. Qiao's fate is still unknown,

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.410
and even if he's alive,

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.500
he would certainly be a major offender
in the eyes of the Japanese.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.900
Finding him would be extremely difficult.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.890
But as for British POWs like William,
as far as I know,

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.650
the Japanese have captured
over 10,000 of them,

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.210
all held in the Stanley POW Camp.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.320
I don't think
they'd pay much attention to him.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.260
Hmm.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.430
For now, our plan

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.570
is to first look into
William's whereabouts.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.310
My brother Zhengping is currently
in Hong Kong.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.850
He's well-connected

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.150
and knows many people.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.840
I'll ask him to do whatever he can
to find out.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:34.850
Dr. Ke.

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.890
If possible,

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.760
could you ask your brother

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:42.990
to look into my brother's situation?

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.930
Please rest assured, Yinwan.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.390
If there's even the slightest possibility,

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.200
I'll have him do his best.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.500
Next.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.280
Short beep.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.450
Short beep, short beep, long beep.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.510
It's the letter...

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.350
Can you please pay attention?

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:08.620
Oh my.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.370
All these dots and dashes

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.100
and beeps are driving me crazy.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.710
If you're this impatient,

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:16.510
when will you ever finish
decoding this telegram?

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.290
So what telegram is this?

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.980
This is my first telegram
to the higher-ups

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:22.710
as the service station chief.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:25.040
What's this telegram about?

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:25.929
Want to know?

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:27.540
Then study hard.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.370
Once you learn how to decode,

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:30.770
you'll know what I wrote.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.960
I'll pick it up again next time.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.710
What's going on with you today?

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.909
You've been distracted since yesterday.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.489
What exactly happened?

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.880
Say something.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.500
Ke Zhengping responded.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.500
He said they found Qiao Renyu's

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.760
and William's whereabouts.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.620
Stanley Prison's death row section?

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.950
He was previously held at
the Hong Kong Gendarmerie Headquarters

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:10.680
and was just transferred over.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.540
Security there is extremely tight,

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.910
making it very difficult
to find out the details.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:15.730
So...

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.730
Mr. Qiao

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520
is inaccessible,

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.170
while William is being held
in the POW Camp.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.270
My brother

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.620
has found

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.230
a way to reach him.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.020
Since Mary and William
are husband and wife,

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.390
Yang Chang and Mary will

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:38.050
go to Hong Kong to find William

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.400
and try to find out
the whereabouts of the printing plates.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.180
If William really knows,

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.320
the Hong Kong side
will find a way to rescue him

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.230
so he can take

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.100
Yang Chang and Mary
to find the printing plates.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.120
So that means

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.960
if William knows,

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.660
then he'll be the only one rescued.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.440
Is that right?

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.190
Alright.

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:19.710
I understand.

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:49.560
[Nam Wah Dispensary, Hong Kong]

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.270
Mrs. Smith,

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.330
the premium ginseng you ordered
has just arrived.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.140
Want to come inside and check it out?

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.450
Alright, let's.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:56.690
Please come in.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:04.280
[Stanley POW Camp] [Stanley Prison]

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.140
This is Stanley POW Camp.

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.910
Right next to it is Stanley Prison.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.580
Both POWs and criminals

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.660
are under the prison's
unified supervision.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.520
There's a Taiwanese guard in there,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.160
who's a secret member of the Taiwan
Anti‑Japanese Guerrilla Forces.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.710
He was the one who helped us find out

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.370
about Qiao Renyu and William.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.330
How is William doing now?

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.060
He's now the head foreman of
both the prison and the POW Camp.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:29.630
Head foreman?

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.480
The upside is that

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.060
it makes it easier for you to reach him.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:33.810
Why?

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:37.060
There are tens of thousands of
British POWs in there.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:37.980
The Japanese

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.080
can't do without people like William
who both speak English

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.730
and are willing to work as their lackeys
to help manage.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.560
So they treat William quite well

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.650
as a head foreman.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:46.980
If he gets sick,

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.040
he has the opportunity
to seek medical care outside.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.850
Look.

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.160
There's a small medical facility
right next to the prison.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.830
It originally served the British Army,

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.830
but now it provides medical care
for Japanese guards.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:59.100
Most of the medical staff retained

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.520
are former British army personnel.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.770
I've already lined things up

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:04.770
to sneak you in.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.950
Tomorrow, the Taiwanese guard
will be on duty.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.020
He'll find a way to drug William.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.660
Once William enters the medical facility,

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.990
it'll be up to Mary
to get the information.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:46.770
William!

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.180
William, it's me, Mary.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:54.660
Mary?

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.530
Shh, keep your voice down.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:57.410
How...

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:58.610
How did you get here?

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.230
[Casualty Ward]

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:17.450
You,

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.890
Chief of the British Army Aid Group?

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.380
Mary, are you kidding me?

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:23.080
William.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.710
I'm not joking.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.710
This is serious.

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:25.890
Oh, I see.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.540
You stayed in Macau for me?

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.370
I cannot believe it. This is amazing.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.330
I'm very touched...

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:30.860
William.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:31.910
Focus.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.290
I need to ask you some questions.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.600
So you left the scene of the bombing?

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:51.750
You left Qiao Renyu
and the printing plates?

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:52.880
Of course I escaped.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.890
What do you expect?

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.810
Me standing there, waiting to be blown up?

00:39:55.810 --> 00:39:57.140
Stop with the nonsense.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:57.950
Let's get out of here.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:58.830
Just stay put.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:00.190
I'll be back in a moment.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.980
Where are you going?

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:02.350
If you don't want the Japanese
to find you,

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.330
you stay here and be quiet.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:07.890
So you mean

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:10.390
William has no idea
where the printing plates are?

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:11.190
That's right.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.960
Now Qiao Renyu is our only hope.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.580
We must initiate Plan B

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.570
and try to rescue him.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.710
But Qiao Renyu is a death row prisoner.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:20.580
It's hard even to make contact with him.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.780
How can we rescue him?

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:24.660
I have an idea

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.140
which might be worth trying.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.340
But we'll need William's cooperation.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.270
Qiao Renyu,

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.620
the death row prisoner?

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.890
How do you expect me to
get close to him, huh?

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.270
You bribe that guard Fujii all the time.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.980
You know him.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:39.810
He's greedy.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.790
Just give him some cash
and he'll play along.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:43.540
How do you know all of this?

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.480
Look. There's no time to explain.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.620
Is it a yes or no?

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.990
Yes or no?

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:48.080
Yes or no?

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.270
Even if I see him,

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.930
how can I possibly
sneak him out of prison?

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.070
Same way that you got sick.
You'll get sick too.

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.390
I have the medicine.
He just needs to take it,

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:58.520
he'll fall suddenly ill.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:40:59.580
He's a high-profile prisoner.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.730
The Japanese have no choice

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.080
but to take him to the clinic.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.410
As long as he takes it...

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.180
This. Here's some money.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.580
Enough to cover Fujii's salary
for 2 years.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.430
And this is Qiao Renyu's medicine.

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.140
Who are you?

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:18.770
No.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:19.620
No.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:20.730
I can't do this.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.130
If the Japanese catch me,

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:22.910
they'll kill me!

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:23.640
William!

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.040
Qiao Renyu is essential to us.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.510
If we don't rescue him,

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:30.540
there's no way to move forward.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.390
He's essential?

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.540
He's essential?

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.660
I am your husband!

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.460
If you have to save someone,
you save me first!

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.460
Just calm down,

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:36.980
okay?

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.410
Okay, dear.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:41.560
I love you.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.910
I'll always love you, all right?

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:45.180
All this time.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:47.560
You kept me alive, you understand?

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.450
This is not the time to...

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.460
This is the time! This is the time, dear!

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.180
You're my wife.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.180
I'm your husband.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:53.830
Let's get out of here.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.500
I love you. I promise.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.960
I promise, this is gonna be all right.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.020
No.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.620
William, I really don't have time
for this.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.080
Lieutenant William Jones
of the Imperial Navy.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.160
I'm ordering you

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:34.410
as Chief of the British Army Aid Group

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:36.600
to assist in the rescue of Qiao Renyu.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.910
If you're still a British soldier,

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.120
you will obey this order.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.040
This is what we are?

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:40.980
We are strangers now,

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:41.390
right?

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.450
This is how you talk to your husband?

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:44.250
You know what?

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:45.980
I'm not

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.310
a navy officer anymore.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.160
Look at me.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.270
I'm a prisoner now.

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.480
I don't have to take any orders.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.620
What would it take

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.410
for you to help?
