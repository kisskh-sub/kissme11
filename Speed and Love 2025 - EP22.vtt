[Speed and Love]

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.820
[Episode 22]

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.540
The phoenix trees in Nanjing
have a long history

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.750
and many stories.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.840
The most accurate account

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.350
is that they were planted

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.980
for the enshrinement ceremony

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.100
of Sun Yat-sen.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.070
But do you know

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.980
why they chose phoenix trees?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.610
Why?

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.190
Back then, when they were

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.440
choosing green plants,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.300
the city planners preferred them

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.540
for their shape and shade,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.140
so they planted them

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.500
along the main streets.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.440
You know quite a lot about this.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.820
In autumn,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.380
the golden canopy of phoenix trees

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.960
stretches across the city
from east to west,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.680
which is very romantic.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.650
Let's go.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.590
Have you settled in?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.290
I rented a place close to the observatory.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.020
The environment is nice

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.860
and it's convenient for work.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.990
That's pretty good.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.990
Nanjing is a magical city.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.600
It has a rich history

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.660
and a strong sense of everyday life,

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.100
always giving a feeling of stability.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.410
By the way,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.790
what kind of coffee do you like?

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.100
Vanilla latte with a hint of cinnamon.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.870
What does...

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.090
that taste like?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.850
I don't really remember.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.820
What you want to remember

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.100
isn't the taste of the coffee,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.700
but the person

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.350
you shared it with, right?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.540
What is the guy

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.170
who gave you the pen doing now?

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.070
I don't know.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.430
Alright.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.510
After we go back to Nanjing,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.700
if you want to run a garage,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.780
I'll do it with you.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.380
If not,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.830
we can open a coffee shop together.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.230
Why a coffee shop?

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.630
I just feel it would be nice for us

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.360
to open a coffee shop together.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.560
We must choose a location at the foot
of a mountain with phoenix trees.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.800
In autumn,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.080
the golden leaves of phoenix trees
would cover the ground,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.950
and Lightning would run back and forth
over them.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.280
How happy that would be.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.340
Actually, my dream

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.350
is to open a small coffee shop
like this one.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.050
I've already thought of a name.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.450
It will be called "Moon."

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.870
It has to be on a street

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.370
lined with phoenix trees.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.110
In autumn,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.270
when the osmanthus flowers
bloom in Nanjing,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.130
the warm breeze
carries its fragrance everywhere.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.520
People stroll along the long streets

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.910
and grab a cup of their favorite coffee.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.070
How delightful.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.510
Sounds nice.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.790
But considering how expensive
storefront rent is in Nanjing,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.680
you'll need to save up quite a bit.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.340
During the years I studied in Canada,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.540
I tutored on weekends

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.990
and school breaks.
I've already saved enough.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.220
So does that mean your coffee shop dream

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.420
can be realized soon?

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.220
Not yet.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920
Before that,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.060
there's something else I need to do.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.560
Ms. Jiang, I'll be there in 5 minutes.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.580
I'll explain the details

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.240
of the old house when I arrive.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.340
Enjoy.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.460
Thank you, sir.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.510
Ms. Jiang,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.510
seriously,
don't make this difficult for me.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.780
That house you're interested in

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.870
was sold last year.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.950
I'm really sincere about this.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.070
Could you ask the buyer

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.460
if they'd consider reselling it?

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.340
I can

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.750
offer up to

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.140
a 30 percent premium.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.950
My colleagues and I have asked around.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.750
The buyer

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.480
is a big businessman from Beijing.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.360
He confirmed the deal

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.380
and paid in full the same day.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.920
Do you really think
he'd care about that amount of money?

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.420
Please, help me ask again.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.930
If that doesn't work,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.320
arrange a meeting with that buyer.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.250
I'll try to persuade him in person.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.950
Alright.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:47.710
I'll ask again for you.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.320
Good.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.460
Thank you.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.810
I'll be going now.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.150
Sit.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.310
Good boy.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.380
-You did a great job today.
-Sit.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.150
Let's go.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.550
If Lightning hadn't gone missing,

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.870
it would be this big by now.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.430
[Six years ago]

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:28.990
Thanks.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.230
When are you leaving?

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.120
The 8th.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.020
By the way, Sanlai,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.240
I've asked.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:44.960
Lightning's vaccines have expired,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.680
so it probably won't be able
to enter the country with me.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.090
Could you help

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.540
have it vaccinated next month

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.660
and send it over?

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.640
I'll order a pet carrier for it.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:54.590
Jiang Mu,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.900
I might have some bad news.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.270
What's wrong?

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.140
Lightning is missing.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.460
Missing?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.950
How is that possible?

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.710
Didn't I tell you before

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.910
that Lightning needed to be neutered?

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.950
When a dog goes into heat,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.070
it just runs off.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.310
Last night I thought

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.070
it'd just run around and come back,

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.400
but when I went looking for it,
it was gone.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.800
I'm sorry.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.430
I didn't take good care of Lightning.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.430
But don't worry.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.000
I know how this works.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.320
It was probably

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.820
lured away
by some little female dog nearby.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.550
It might even come back

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.790
with a girlfriend.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960
And if it doesn't,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.660
I'll have Xishi give birth
to a better-looking one

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.750
and send it to you, okay?

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.420
No!

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.150
I only want Lightning!

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.550
How could it get lost?

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.790
I've had it for so long

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.150
that I'm attached to it.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.850
I only want Lightning.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.490
We can find it, right?

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.380
Why did this have to happen now?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.240
Even Lightning...

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.660
is abandoning me?

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.000
Don't think like that.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.740
Don't be sad.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.360
It's just a little dog.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.100
Lightning means

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.150
more than just a dog to me.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.370
I see.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.680
I'll definitely find Lightning
and bring it back.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.300
Jiang Mu,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.620
if one day

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.310
Brandy doesn't want you anymore

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.280
and you're unhappy abroad,

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:54.880
then come back.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.750
I'll take you in.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.800
I'll take good care of you.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.980
Jin Zhao...

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.810
won't abandon me.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.850
[Purple Mountain Observatory]

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:07.880
Here you go.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:13.820
Mu.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.480
Take a look at our latest proposal

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.410
for the Jupiter satellite system.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:03.950
Ms. Jiang,

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.970
I checked with them 3 times a day

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.340
for a whole week.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.340
They said their boss

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.740
finally has time to meet.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.050
But they said he's extremely busy

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.970
and travels a lot.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.100
And he's only in Nanjing

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.550
one day a month.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.950
Then let's do it that day.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.540
Alright.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.990
I'll let you know

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.470
as soon as it's confirmed.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:21.670
Thank you.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.320
Is it...

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.530
your dog?

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.980
No, it belongs to our coffee shop.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.000
When our boss isn't around,

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:52.980
we staff members

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.390
take turns walking it.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.110
It's usually pretty quiet,

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.590
but today it's so clingy.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.910
Really different from usual.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.640
Seems like it really likes you.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.510
It...

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.670
looks a lot like a dog I used to have.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.920
What a coincidence!

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.220
I should get going now.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.230
Jiang Mu,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.640
how have you been?

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.180
Pretty good.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.740
I've settled in here.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.120
That's good to hear.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.710
I've been assigned to Beijing

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.020
on a long business trip

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.540
and probably won't be back anytime soon.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.600
Take care of yourself then.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:40.790
Thanks.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.050
Actually, I called you

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.180
because there's something else
I wanted to tell you.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.190
What is it?

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.620
On the day I left,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.660
something interesting happened.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.980
I was taking a taxi to the airport

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.890
and passed through
a phoenix tree-lined boulevard.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:54.890
Guess what I saw?

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.150
What?

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.580
I saw a coffee shop.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.310
Its name

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.620
was actually "Moon."

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.840
Someone opened a coffee shop

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.750
called Moon
along the phoenix tree-lined boulevard

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.410
at the foot of Zijin Mountain.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.100
That person couldn't be you, could it?

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.070
How could it be?

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.270
Did I ever tell you?

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.270
It's just my dream.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.600
It hasn't come true yet.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.720
What a coincidence.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.420
Who could it be then?

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.470
They actually made your dream come true.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.110
Where is that coffee shop?

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.870
I'll send you the address right now.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:56.860
Strange.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.610
How did I end up in a park?

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.070
What a coincidence. We meet again.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.710
Yes.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:14.850
Bye.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.080
It belongs to our coffee shop.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.430
It's usually pretty quiet,

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.980
but today it's so clingy.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.340
Really different from usual.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.070
Seems like it really likes you.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.840
Lightning?

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.900
Lightning!

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.480
Lightning!

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.630
It really is you!

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.440
Where are you taking me?

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:04.680
Doggy?

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.100
We must choose a location at the foot
of a mountain with phoenix trees.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.340
In autumn,

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.620
the golden leaves of phoenix trees
would cover the ground,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.440
and Lightning would run back and forth
over them.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.770
How happy that would be.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:31.480
Moon?

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.600
Lightning.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.960
Welcome to Moon. What would you like to...

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.700
Why is the dog back? Where's Jia?

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.000
Quiet, why are you back here on your own?

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.470
Quiet?

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.550
Did it lead you to the coffee shop?

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.080
I can't believe it has learned
how to bring in customers.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.020
The menu is there.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.950
Would you like to order something?

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.830
I order delivery from you all the time.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.630
I didn't expect
the shop to be hidden here.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.980
You can't even see the sign
from the entrance.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.370
A lot of customers say that.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.300
Our boss just doesn't want

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.430
to cut down the trees in the courtyard.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.460
Your boss is really laid-back.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:20.660
By the way,

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.320
I always order your vanilla latte.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.070
Do you have any other recommendations?

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.320
[House Special]

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.150
Why don't you try our "Moon?"

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.540
It's our bestseller here.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:30.870
Many customers love it.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.650
Sure.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.930
Alright,
please wait over there for a moment.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.730
Okay, thanks.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.610
Miss,
have you decided what you'd like to drink?

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.390
Miss?

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:45.480
This "Moon"

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.390
has a really unique design.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.850
That was personally designed by our boss.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.320
So would you like to try it?

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.630
I'll have one too.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.370
Alright, please wait over there as well.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.910
Here's your coffee.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.430
This is for our customers to play with.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.090
A child messed it up last time,

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.870
and we didn't know how to fix it.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.610
You know how to use a telescope too?

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.230
If you want to use it during the day,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.710
you can add a Baader filter.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.880
You might be able to see sunspots.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:23.540
Okay, thank you.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.750
Here's your coffee.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.330
It really is him.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.380
He's back.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.150
Do you need anything else?

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.190
Is Quiet your shop's dog?

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.260
No, it's our boss's.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.220
He just keeps the dog at the shop

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.820
when he's on business trips.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.490
A coffee shop owner
needs to go on business trips too?

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.840
The coffee shop is his side business;
he has a main job.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.160
Actually,
the coffee shop is his main business,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.390
and he has other side ventures.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.360
Is there a difference between the two?

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.600
Of course.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.120
Without side ventures,

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.920
this shop probably
would have gone under long ago.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:37.890
Gone under?

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.460
Isn't your shop making money?

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:43.390
I heard our business
was really bad a couple of years ago,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.150
but our boss kept the shop alive

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.190
through other ventures.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.950
This year,
we've had more returning customers,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.410
so business is doing well.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.070
So where is he now?

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.040
On another business trip?

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.310
Today I think he went back to school

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.740
for his thesis proposal.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.700
School?

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.460
Is he very young?

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.670
No.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.480
Our boss is in his thirties.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.780
He's just been continuing his studies
at university.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.590
He's quite hardworking.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.640
-Our boss is Superman.
-Our boss is Superman.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.960
He's super busy every day.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.220
And has a lot to handle.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:15.110
What's his name?

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.100
His name is...

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.180
How about this?

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.350
You can...

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.020
talk to us first.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.760
Could you give me his contact info?

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:27.070
I have something very important
to consult with him about.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:27.910
Alright.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.150

register.

Register?

Just write your name, contact info,

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.860
and request in it.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.120
Currently you should be...

20th in line.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.110
20th?

What about the 19 people ahead of me?

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.500
They're just like you—

special requests for our boss.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.430

Every girl who comes here

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.660

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.810
Well, miss.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.260
I'm really sorry.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.670
I can't give you

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.070
our boss's contact info.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.110
However, if you register,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.500
I'll report it to him.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:10.670
If he's interested,

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.500
I'm sure he'll reach out to you.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.910
So please register first.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:34.810

Alright. Thank you.

The owner of this coffee shop
is pretty handsome,

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.700
but he has a rather aloof personality,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.900
giving off a complete "stay away" vibe.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.680
He is indeed very handsome.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.040
Is the owner single?

When chatting with the staff,

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.190
I heard he's married,

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.860
and his wife and children
are settled abroad.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.520
He's married?

A pen. Have you seen it?

Yes. It was originally in the pen holder.

for it the next day.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.410
