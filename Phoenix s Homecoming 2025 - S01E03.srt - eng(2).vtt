00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.480
Where did you go

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.040
so early, my lord?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.719
I meant to buy some snacks for you,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.239
but heard that Zhuozhou's

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.519
400,000 taels of relief fund was stolen.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.000
Everything is in chaos.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.280
Really?

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:42.439
What a shame.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.480
So it was Your Highness's scheme.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.519
It's such a heinous crime.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.079
How could you pin it on me, my lord?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.599
I couldn't bear such blame.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.239
You're not a good student.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.239
Lying isn't a good habit.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.120
If you returned

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.239
to be the schemer,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.840
I'll be your pawn,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.879
at your command.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.960
(I want you to meet Su Wei)

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.919
(and tell him what to do.)

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.719
(Will you do it?)

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.240
Grand Tutor.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.879
I didn't

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:33.680
expect that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.159
only you would come to see me.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.240
I'm deeply moved.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.360
I'm just a commoner.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.960
I can't accept
so grand a gesture, Governor.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.879
Are you alright?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.280
Though you have resigned,

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.719
everyone at court knows that

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.520
His Majesty values you most.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.400
Besides,

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.199
the Xie family has always

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.759
held great influence
in the court thanks to its reputation.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.080
I'll keep your secret

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.560
with that handsome young man.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:08.759
You should know

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.960
that I'm here for the millions
of common people

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.280
and disaster victims.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.560
Yeah, I understand, my lord.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.680
The victims can't wait.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.960
Indeed.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.919
Money is such a marvelous thing.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:33.800
Everyone craves it.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.759
I understand, my lord.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.280
As long as you help me get over this,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.560
I'll offer you 50,000 taels of silver.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.599
You're so generous.

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:54.520
In that case,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.560
I'll inform my family members

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.719
to suppress the news at court.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.520
However,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.000
400,000 taels isn't a small sum.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.879
No one could have smuggled it

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.520
out of Zhuozhou undetected overnight.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.800
Zhuozhou is your territory, Governor.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.079
You'll surely recover the money
sooner or later.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.079
Why don't you

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.560
raise 400,000 taels of silver
and deliver it to the disaster zone

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.839
for now?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.720
But...

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.319
As things stand,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.720
take your time to consider, Governor.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.439
I'll take my leave.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.360
Thank you for the guidance, Grand Tutor.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.000
I bet Su Wei will have the money

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:02.959
by tomorrow
with his wealth-amassing skills.

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:04.399
Not tomorrow.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:06.439
He'll have it ready today.

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.160
He may even

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:10.879
send you a generous gift.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.839
Would you care to wager with me?

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:16.959
No need.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:19.160
I believe whatever

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.279
Your Highness says.

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:29.279
I-I misplaced it.

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:30.560
I take it back.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.079
When you taught me chess years ago,

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:43.560
didn't you say

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.680
that a gentleman
never regrets his moves?

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:51.199
Why did you let me retract that move?

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:52.720
When playing against me,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.199
you always have that privilege.

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.879
Who is it?

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:16.120
Governor Su sent me
to deliver something, Lord Xie.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.839
I'm deeply impressed, Your Highness.

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:26.639
Su Wei is so generous.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:28.959
But Grand Tutor,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.240
are you accepting these?

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.839
When it comes to money,

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.680
no one ever feels they have enough.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.560
You'll know in due time

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.680
how I will spend the money.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.839
I imagine Su Wei

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.560
is nursing his financial wounds at home.

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:58.879
My lord.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.800
It took us years to accumulate these.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.439
Giving them away

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.000
is like cutting our flesh.

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:08.600
You fool.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.279
Short-sighted.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.759
Do you know how many censors
have impeached me?

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.160
Without Lord Xie,

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.399
who could shield me from condemnation?

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.160
Then why don't we just

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.480
ask the wealthy for a donation

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:22.120
or impose taxes on commoners?

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.959
Why cover the gap with our money?

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.480
Do you know why
the Censorate impeached me?

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:29.319
For inadequate disaster relief

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:31.079
and oppressing the people.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.480
Don't worry, my lord.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.560
As long as we're around, there's hope.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.079
As you instructed,

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.279
we bought rice

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.680
from farmers at market price.

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.560
Tomorrow we'll buy more

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.199
in neighboring towns
to cover the shortage.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.399
Good.

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:45.680
Good.

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:48.279
Tie the red ropes and send the supplies

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.399
to the disaster-stricken areas.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.920
Let every commoner know

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.920
that I'm devoted to serving the people.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.680
Understood.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.639
Spare some change.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.279
Please.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.160
Spare some change.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.600
Show mercy.

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:07.839
Thank you.

00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:08.560
Thank you.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.680
You should understand

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:11.639
the people's suffering.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:14.639
Commoners have no land to farm.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:18.040
Merchants profit nothing
under heavy taxes.

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:20.399
Spare some change.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.279
Yet officials sell positions for profit.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:27.600
I have been busy half my life,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.759
claiming

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.759
to serve the state and the people.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.360
But in fact, I'm utterly powerless.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.879
This state belongs

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.639
to the Chen family.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:49.879
My mother was also a Chen.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.240
Thus I see the Chens

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:55.399
as my own kin.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.080
For years, I worked for the Chen State

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.000
only to end up

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.000
losing my own life.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.600
Chancellor Huo holds power now.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.240
What ambitions can you have?

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:16.080
I just wonder how much
my dear brother knew

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:18.519
about what happened

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.799
and how much

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.919
he was involved.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.919
His Majesty...

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.399
His mind is unfathomable.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:30.639
There will be time.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.720
We'll uncover the truth.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.519
Is there anything else

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:43.039
I can do for Your Highness?

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.399
I never expected

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.480
that you'd grow accustomed so quickly

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.159
to being my pawn.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.559
As a pawn,

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:56.200
I naturally obey my master.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.000
Didn't you

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.320
want to know how I would

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:06.399
spend the money?

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:09.679
Let me show you.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.424
(Chaohuang Academy)

00:10:22.912 --> 00:10:24.576
(Chaohuang Academy)

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.080
You wrote "Chaohuang Academy"

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:29.679
in person.

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:41.039
Every woman in the Chen State

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:43.120
should be educated

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.480
and enlightened,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.240
regardless of status.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.000
Lord Xie, you've finally come.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.120
You've no idea how much I missed you.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.519
(Hua.)

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:04.559
Do you miss me

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.679
or the money?

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.679
You got me wrong.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.360
Money can't compare to feelings.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.320
You've cared for the Grand Princess

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.279
and supported our academy for years.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.759
We are deeply grateful to you.

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.480
I did that

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.759
for you girls

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.840
who, I believe, deserve an education,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.159
not the Grand Princess.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.879
Love-struck fool.

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:24.200
If not for Her Highness,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.960
why would you resign

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.200
as Grand Tutor?

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:29.200
When the hare is dead,
the hound is boiled.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:31.000
His Majesty is ruling now.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.320
Isn't it the wisest move for me to quit?

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.120
Then why are you roaming the land,

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.679
hunting corrupt officials?

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.159
As subjects of the Chen State,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.799
shouldn't we safeguard

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:41.080
the state?

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:43.799
Then why do you fight
those who gossip about

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:45.159
the Grand Princess?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.240
You...

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.159
Was that for the people, too?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.840
Absolutely love-struck.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.279
You said you needed money

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:01.720
to repair the academy.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.840
Well?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.919
Are you going to

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.279
slack off now?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.759
Nonsense.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.120
If you're not in a hurry,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.240
I'll take it back.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.480
You set up the Chaohuang Academy.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.919
I've maintained it,

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:29.240
merely to keep something

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.120
that belongs to Your Highness.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.799
Now that

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:39.080
you're back,

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:43.480
the Chaohuang Academy
is restored to its rightful owner.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.759
Why did you come?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.879
My fair lady is so cold-hearted,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.840
not missing me one bit.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.159
Not like me, so devoted,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.679
always thinking of you.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:17.919
You are loaded.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:19.480
So you can find romance

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.039
at any pleasure house.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.360
And you're handsome.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.240
Even if short on funds,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.759
you could earn some money

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:28.960
with that face of yours.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:31.039
With your notorious reputation,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.440
how can you claim devotion?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.000
Fine tea.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.840
This is Chancellor Huo's network

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:49.480
you asked me to investigate.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:51.480
Impressive.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.519
But I've also

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.840
completed the task

00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:55.200
you entrusted to me.

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:56.799
That 400,000 taels of silver

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.080
is now in the Chaohuang Academy library.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.559
Early tomorrow morning,

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.320
someone will surely see it.

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:04.879
I am rather curious.

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:07.759
How will Su Wei explain it?

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.639
But my lady,

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.120
I'm more curious about something else.

00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:17.360
Why do you know Chancellor Huo so well?

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.759
We are using each other

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.720
and know each other's hidden thoughts.

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:27.440
Some things

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.600
don't have to be spoken openly.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.600
Well, I merely admire Chancellor Huo.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.919
So I'm observing and learning.

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:38.080
My lady,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.200
I just love

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.000
how you speak riddles.

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:43.000
You were attracted

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.120
to Lord Xie last time.

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:46.919
And now, to Chancellor Huo.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:49.279
Your tastes are quite varied.

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:51.039
You're not sincere.

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:55.679
I'm absolutely sincere.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.200
My heart

00:14:57.879 --> 00:14:59.200
is always with you.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.240
So my lady,

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:02.919
will you

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.279
have me as your beloved?

00:15:05.879 --> 00:15:06.759
No, she won't.
