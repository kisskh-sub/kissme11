[Episode 19]

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.789
Help me take a look—
which one do I look better in?

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.970
Or do you think my figure

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.330
looks good in anything?

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.210
Mu.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.130
What's wrong?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.860
It's not the right time yet.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.000
Come here.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:11.950
Don't you feel hot?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.960
A little.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.890
You're already hot and still this clingy?

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.230
You're the one who's clingy, not me, okay?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.080
Has the race time been set?

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.440
Yeah, it's coming up soon.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.170
Are you still racing against
Mr. Wan and his team?

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.020
This race is also a chance for me

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.130
to settle my issues with Wan Shengbang.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.550
What kind of race is it?

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.510
A mountain obstacle race.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.800
An obstacle race?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.000
Isn't that dangerous?

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.640
I can get the map and the locations

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.260
of the obstacles in advance.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.460
I'll just avoid them.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.730
How did you get it?

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.500
Through Officer Lu.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.760
Officer Lu?

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.250
So you mean

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
besides you, there are other people

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.470
in the organization
who're also assisting Officer Lu?

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.450
Who are they? Do you know them?

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.100
Those accomplices hiding in the shadows.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.370
"Those

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.840
accomplices hiding in the shadows?"

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.560
What kind of talk is that?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.840
It's not that mysterious.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.590
We just each get what we need, that's all.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.610
To get to the bottom of
the smuggling gang,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.820
since I'm leading the charge,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.360
surely I need people
to cooperate from behind.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.620
Each person serves a different purpose.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.560
These matters are quite sensitive,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800
and if we're going to
keep working in this line,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.730
no one wants to expose themselves.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.000
So...

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.490
Has your detective spirit
taken over again?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.140
Aren't you going to sleep?

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.700
I can't let Mu join me

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.140
in living that precarious life
I had before.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.890
I have to win tomorrow's race,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.440
no matter what.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.000
Only by winning

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.170
can I bring an end to all of this,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.440
and only then

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.660
can I be with Mu openly and cleanly.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.360
I owe her this.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.650
Mu.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.760
Don't worry about me.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.680
For you,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.340
I will return victorious.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.970
Dad.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.560
Mom.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.620
If you can see me from wherever you are,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.020
please bless me with success,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.140
and bless me and Mu.

[Speeding Auto House]

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:26.980
Yang took the day off today.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.290
I need to go take care of something.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.780
I might be back a bit late.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.080
Don't worry. Sleep well.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.990
Remember to eat when you wake up.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.160
Be good.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.150
I'll take you out tomorrow,

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.090
okay?

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.160
I have something for you.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.450
This is a set of racing gear.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.530
It's fireproof and heat-resistant,

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.770
kind of a safety measure.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.210
What, do you think

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.580
I need this?

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.610
No matter what kind of race it is,

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.740
safety comes first.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.920
This underground race you're entering

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.470
has high speeds and complex tracks,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.210
and there's no emergency technical team.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.770
But

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.770
this can buy you 20 seconds.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.730
I'm not that fussy,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:30.010
but I appreciate your kind gesture.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.040
Thanks.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.910
Zhao said he needed to go
take care of something.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:29.540
It seems

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.650
that decisive race

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.670
is likely happening today.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.850
Where are you?

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.360
You're up?

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.400
You promised

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.640
to take me out tomorrow, right?

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.710
I'll try.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.770
You promised me.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.140
You can't go back on your word.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.110
If you break your promise,

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.490
I'll never speak to you again.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.720
Got it.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.650
Jiang Mu?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.020
Why are you still here?

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.520
Where else could I go?

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.370
Can I talk to you?

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:52.970
About Brandy's race,

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.140
how much do you know?

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.030
Could Liang Yanfeng also be

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.420
part of the alliance?

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.710
Why are you asking me this?

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.110
I need you to come with me.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.810
Why should I trust you?

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.340
I can't reach him right now.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.690
If you want to save Brandy's life,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.010
you must come with me.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.850
How do I know
you're not just trying to fool me?

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.180
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.940
The number you have dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.670
It was Lu who sent me to find you.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.460
Can we go now?

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.170
Where are you taking her?

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:39.730
Sanlai.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.620
Jin Zhao seems to be in trouble.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.950
I'll go with you.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.810
You can't come.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.200
You're not part of the alliance.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:55.050
Then turn on your phone's location.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:57.710
I'm worried you won't be able to
handle it alone.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.540
What happened to him?

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.180
About what Brandy is doing,

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.770
how much do you really know?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.090
Only the basics.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.680
He can't follow the original route.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.890
What do you mean?

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.130
Someone suspects
there's an undercover cop in the alliance.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.830
They can't identify who it is yet.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.160
If he follows the original route,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.090
he's done for.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.280
The one who provided him
with the route map

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.170
was you?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.130
Get in.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.440
See that mountain?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.850
He's there?

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.990
Go in this direction.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.780
There's just over 40 minutes left
until the race.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.640
If you hurry, you can still make it.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.250
Find Brandy and tell him—

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:03.730
he'll know what to do.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:38.960
Do you find this amusing or what?

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:39.890
Are you ready?

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.300
I'm not.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.940
I don't need to be prepared to beat you.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.140
Don't be so arrogant.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.370
Luck won't always be on your side.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.890
You can't even tell the difference
between skill and luck.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.050
I feel sorry for you.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.990
Then you'd better give it your all.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.650
Don't come up with some excuse

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.610
when you lose.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.530
Only the weak make excuses.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.450
That's great.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.290
Remember to drive a bit faster.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.470
Otherwise, I'll get bored.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.050
Sanlai?

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.220
What do we do now?

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.200
Let me drive.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:44.330
Zhao.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.370
I can't let anything happen to you.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.060
Wait for me.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.170
Someone's ahead.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.500
Stop the car!

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:00.650
Stop the car!

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.190
I told you to stop!

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.900
You ignorant girl!

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.900
Do you even know which is the gas
and which is the brake?

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.330
A woman drove up the mountain in an AE86!

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.220
Why are you here?

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.250
Has Jin Zhao's race started?

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.260
He's in danger.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.090
We need to stop the race immediately.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:40.090
I know where he is.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.590
We're still a bit away
from the starting point.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.720
I'll take you there.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.470
What should we do now?

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.650
What's your business here?
This road is closed.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:53.780
Take another route.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.770
We're here to look for someone.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:57.930
I've told you this road is closed.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:58.650
It doesn't matter
if you're looking for someone, okay?

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.580
Get out of my way.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.180
Stop!

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.050
Go back.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.480
Is this somewhere you're supposed to be?

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.720
We need to go find Jin Zhao.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.650
Let us through.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.160
Do we know each other well or something?

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.140
If you don't want him to get into trouble,

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.060
then help us.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.860
He was the one who told me to get lost.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.930
He only asked you to leave

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.920
because he didn't want to hurt you

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200
or get you involved

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.960
in his feud with Mr. Wan.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.680
You should know better than any of us

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.730
why he's been pushed to this point.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:54.270
You don't have to help him,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.550
unless

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.300
you don't want him to survive either.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.000
Please. I beg you.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.360
Beg me?

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.210
How do you want to beg me?

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.200
Don't go too far.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.410
You think I'm going too far?

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.360
Forget it then.

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.720
Jiang Mu, let's go back
and figure something out ourselves.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.810
Name your terms!

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.080
I'll agree to anything.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.690
Alright then.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:37.850
Kneel.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.520
Jiang Mu, get up. Let's go home.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.170
Jiang Mu!

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.000
Jiang Mu, let's go home now!

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.810
Don't kneel here. Get up!

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.440
Jiang Mu, get up!

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.660
Let them through.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.630
Move aside! Move aside!

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:52.460
Clear the road!

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.060
Move!

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.470
You're too sentimental.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.020
If you keep this up,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.290
you'll have a lot of suffering ahead.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.760
But they're too late anyway.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:51.960

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.590

You won't beat me today.

We'll see about that.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.790
Beating you is way too easy.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:26.740
What,

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.980
is this the limit of your car?

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.580
Try actually surpassing me first.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.310
We can't catch up.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.580
Go up there!

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.780
Sanlai, bring the Luminous Pearl
from the back seat.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.410
Okay.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.200
Where's Brandy?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.860
Why are there no cars on this road?

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.940
It's Brandy's car!

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.460
I saw it!

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.100
Sanlai, give me the Luminous Pearl!

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.720
Okay.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.790
Don't you think racing and fireworks
are similar?

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.010
Both chase the light,

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.740
yet fear it fleeting away in an instant.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.480
You said before

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.520
that you'd sacrifice yourself
for this case.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.000
Now that you have me,

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.090
has your mind changed?

Early this morning,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.610
a serious car accident occurred

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.140
near the extension section

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.810
of Highway 108 in southwest Qingshi.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.650
A car lost control due to excessive speed
and crashed off a cliff,

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.720
resulting in severe damage to the vehicle.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.810
