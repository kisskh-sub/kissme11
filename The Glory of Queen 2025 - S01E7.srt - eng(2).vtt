[The Glory of Queen]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
[Episode 7]

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.020
What's wrong? Are you all right?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.020
I'm fine.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.300
Watch out!

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.860
Careful!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.500
Come out with me first.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.260
I just sprained my ankle.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.140
Hurry! Jingheng is inside!

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.660
Go save him!

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.700
Hurry up!

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.820
Hurry!

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.820
There's water here as well.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.180
It's dangerous! Watch out!

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.500
- Quick, hurry up!
- Lend me a hand here!

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.860
They are out.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.460
Jingheng.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.340
There's still fire over there!

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.740
Jingheng.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.420
There's not enough water!

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.660
Are you all right?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.700
Move faster, quick!

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.060
- Madam.
- Madam.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.700
Mother.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.500
My Lady, although the fire
did not claim Pei Jingheng's life,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.820
his act of secretly bringing
an outsider into the Treasury Pavilion

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.220
is beyond forgiveness.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.500
Madam

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.020
will never allow him
to take charge of the Pei family.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.660
From now on,
no matter how capable he may be,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.260
it will all amount to nothing.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.620
Do you know what I hate most about you?

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.980
You've already said everything.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.460
What's left for me to say?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.340
The Treasury Pavilion
is a restricted area of the household.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.100
Both young masters brought
an outsider in without authorization,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.940
thereby violating the family rules.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.300
Second Young Master

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.580
has taken full responsibility
for the offense

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.020
and will receive fifty lashes
as punishment.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.820
I see.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.020
Second Young Master.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.420
Why are you here?

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.020
I'm truly sorry. Because of me,

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.460
you were punished so harshly.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.820
Don't flatter yourself.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.380
I didn't do it for you.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.260
Why are you so...?

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.140
It was so dangerous then,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.380
and yet you ignored your own safety
to save me.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.100
You're overthinking it.
Even if it were just a cat,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.060
I wouldn't stand by and let it die.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.660
Yes, I was foolish to think so.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.220
I'm nothing more than a maid.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.340
Of course,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.820
how could I deserve such concern
from the Second Young Master?

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.980
Let me tend to your wounds.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.100
Did the wounds scare you?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.620
No.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.860
Don't move.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.740
You'll reopen the wound.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.820
When I apply the ointment later,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.940
if it hurts, just cry out.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.500
There's no one else here.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.820
In this household,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.740
people only care about results.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.100
No one has ever cared

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.860
whether I'm in pain.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.220
You're human. Of course, you feel pain.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.140
You're not some beast.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.900
As for me,
my rule of thumb in life is this:

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.660
nothing matters more than staying alive.

Second Young Master,

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.860
by all accounts
the Pei household is a prestigious one.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.540
You are the Second Young Master
of the Pei family,

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.860
raised in luxury and comfort.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.100
Yet for some reason, I always feel

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.940
that you don't seem truly happy.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.340
The one thing a person can never choose

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.820
is their birth.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.380
Just like the Pei Manor you see now,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.220
outwardly it appears
splendid and glorious,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.820
yet in truth, it is gradually declining.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.870
My grandmother
has exhausted all her strength

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.740
to keep this household standing,

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.340
and she has long placed her ambition
to restore the Pei family

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.460
entirely upon me.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.860
Because of this,
my aunt came to harbor resentment,

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.300
growing to hate me to the bone,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.900
so much so that she even wished
to take my life.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.100
You knew from the very beginning

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.860
that the fire
was set by your aunt, didn't you?

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.180
Though she is your own flesh and blood,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.260
she wished you dead.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.780
Yet you still clung to kinship

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.900
and took all the blame for her.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.020
You must be in great pain.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.860
Mother,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.060
please just take a sip of the medicine.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.580
Who are you suffering like this for?

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.980
Besides me, who else
would truly care about you?

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.300
Yes, I may be a bit willful normally,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.340
but in the end,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.020
I am the only one truly qualified

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.220
to inherit the position of family head.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.740
That line of your eldest son
is utterly unreliable,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.780
yet they still covet
the Pei family's estate.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.660
How laughably overconfident.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:15.900
My Lady,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.620
it's getting late,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.060
and Madam is weary.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.740
You should head back first.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.580
Second Young Master has devoted himself

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.300
to the Pei family all these years.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.620
This fire is suspicious.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:38.540
It's likely that he

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.060
has borne burdens for the Pei family
that he shouldn't have had to.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.700
I am well aware of Jingheng's virtues,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.780
but it's a pity he isn't a girl.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.140
I even brought you some pastries to eat.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.620
Did you steal these?

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:53.940
Why would I do that?

00:08:53.941 --> 00:09:00.715
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.860
I work for you now,

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.820
so I took them openly.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:00.780
Here.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.740
You've improved.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:02.820
Of course.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.420
Thank you.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.940
You are welcome.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:07.940
Is it good?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.180
Not bad.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.060
By the way,

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.300
I've already added you

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.820
to the list
for the Fragrance Competition.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.940
Make sure to prepare well.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.580
There must be no mistakes.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.660
You want me
to go to the Fragrance Competition?

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.060
The winner gets fifty gold.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.180
Do you have the guts to go?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.500
You underestimated me.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.620
That's fifty gold, after all.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.140
Besides, it's a perfect chance
to become part of the Pei family's

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:39.940
fragrance-making nucleus.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.420
Very well.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.060
Give it your best.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.100
Show me what you can do.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.780
Then just wait and see.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.860
Want more?

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.140
I haven't finished this one yet.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.100
Pei Jingheng,

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.660
stop pretending to be a saint.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.740
It was the feud between you and Aunt

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.860
that dragged us into this,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.300
so it's only right
that you shoulder all the blame.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.860
Now, even Song Zhiyao
feels guilty toward you

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.060
and is being kind to you.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.580
You're not like Jingheng.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.460
What matters most

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.140
is understanding who you are.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.980
You don't have Jingheng's talent,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.420
nor his capability.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.300
In the future,
just focus on marrying well.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.380
Jingheng will be there to support you.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.060
Eldest Young Master,
you should focus on your own affairs.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.060
At a time like this,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.900
it would be best not to disturb Madam.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.420
Why?

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.060
Why is it that you're favored

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.100
by Grandmother, Father,
and everyone else,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.380
while I can only live in your shadow?

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.840
"O geese, O geese, O geese!

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.580
You crane your neck
and sing to the sky your song sweet.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.140
Your white feathers
float on green water with ease.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.500
- You swim through..."
- Jingheng.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.340
Don't lead Jingheng astray.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.780
Go play by yourself.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.020
Jingheng, let's keep going
with the recitation.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.380
Just because he was born a little later,

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.700
you're all biased toward him,

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.860
nurturing him
and teaching him with care,

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.140
putting him first in everything.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.700
I'm the firstborn, after all.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.540
It's unfair!

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.540
This isn't fair!

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.900
I want to take back everything
that belongs to me.
