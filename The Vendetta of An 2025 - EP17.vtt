[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.910
Little one.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.940
You've got quite the appetite.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.050
Here.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.160
Have something sour to cut the grease.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.930
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.800
I'm full.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.740
Good.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.570
Settle the bill.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.850
Your father and I were like brothers.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.650
No need to pay.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.740
Father is father. I am me.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.370
I don't like owing anyone anything.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.460
I'm leaving, Mr. Yang.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.070
No.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.360
Take all of it.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.930
This boy.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.770
Who knows what he'll be like when he grows up.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.780
[Episode 17]

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.690
Sir.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.530
Take care.

[All-Goods Shop]

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.860
The pageboy hid himself in the Cangshui River.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.550
Is he fine?

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.060
Fine?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.490
He was howling nonstop.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.180
To keep me from getting out,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.140
he nearly chewed through the skiff.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.530
Speaking of which,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.950
something this important,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.110
you really plan to entrust him with it?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.630
He's the only one who can pull it off.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.930
He's not Huben.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.990
He's someone who admires your junior sister.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.140
I've seen him.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.080
He's a servant by Yang Chuhao's side.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.340
What did you just say?

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.420
He admires Xiaoqing?

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.060
With that kind of energy,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.610
he'd be better off getting his eyes checked.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.930
Xiaoqing is a good girl.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.240
Don't talk too much.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.400
Xiaoqing has never been good at music, chess, calligraphy, or painting.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.560
But she is a little glutton.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.900
So you should cater to what she likes.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.770
Then may I ask, sir,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.210
what she likes to eat

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.930
and drink?

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.420
Could you give me some guidance?

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.180
I'm not sure about that.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.770
But girls

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.330
tend to like a bit of something sweet.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.970
Thank you, sir.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.140
You blockhead.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.900
Thanks.

You are here.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.430
Have a seat first.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.790
- All right. - I'll get you a bowl of wontons.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.220
Here.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.100
Good.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.860
Boss.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.330
For

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.660
the past half month, you've been wearing that gloomy face.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.540
Is it that obvious?

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.490
Of course.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.800
Boss.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.660
Su came looking for me on purpose.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.120
He said,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.450
you and I are old acquaintances,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.860
so he asked if I had any way

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.690
to ease your worries.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.000
That boy.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.220
Well,

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.450
what advice did you,

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.060
my old partner, give him?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.370
None.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.860
I told him

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.840
the boss is not an ordinary man.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.180
What troubles the boss

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.600
can only be solved by Heaven.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.840
Boss.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.740
We've both

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.060
lived several decades, one way or another.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.330
When it comes to matters truly hard to decide,

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.300
I think

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.010
this is the only way.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.660
Sha

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.680
is also one of the Liu faction.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.540
You've been the one sheltering him.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.410
So in some way,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.230
you are a man who remembers past ties.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.420
A man of feeling.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.370
I do not wish for him to die.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.800
What happens next

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.250
I must entrust to you, Mr. Yang.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.780
At our age,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.780
we don't have many friends left.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.310
You must

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.060
not let anything happen to you.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.220
Heads,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.440
and I enjoy wealth and peace.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.370
Tails,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.810
and I repay my debts.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.660
Stop.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.860
This city wall can't stop me,

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.400
and it won't trap you either.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.060
Rest assured.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.010
Don't be afraid.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.220
I had been thinking

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.220
that after you woke up,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.420
I wouldn't know how to face you.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.860
You are the Emperor.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.620
I am nothing more than a commoner.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.530
Should I call you Wuyang

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.690
or call you Your Majesty?

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.500
I don't know.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.220
But now it's settled.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.140
We're parting ways,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.530
and you're still not awake.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.050
But I still have other matters

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.080
and must leave Cangshui River for now.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:11.810
From here on,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.460
Mr. Long will send people to look after you.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.670
Don't worry.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.420
Wuyang.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.570
If I come back alive,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.420
I'll go on taking care of you.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.020
If I die,

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.540
it will count as a valiant death for the realm

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.140
and I won't have disgraced our Xiao clan.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.020
I'm leaving.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:36.930
Wuyang,

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.930
when you're not holding a blade,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.930
you're actually easy to get along with.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.330
Here.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.050
Thank you.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.850
Where is he?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.820
Are you the lad from the salt shop?

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.460
Sir.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.260
I'll take it.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.450
So you still know how to show your face.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.330
You've skipped work for days on end.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.210
Are you

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.060
planning to quit on me?

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.140
No, sir.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.640
Something came up at home.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.500
You reek of medicine.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.500
What is it?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.570
Is your family member gravely ill again?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.610
Do you have enough money for the medicine?

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.900
If not,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.260
I'll lend you some.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.210
It's not that.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.090
Forget it, go on in.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.700
Go inside.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.540
All right.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.330
Here.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.060
Have some tea.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.370
Hold it.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.330
Warm yourself up.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.930
You really don't seem short on money.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:20.900
Look at you.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.180
A whole new outfit.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.640
New clothes.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.610
All dressed up all of a sudden.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.660
You must have someone you fancy.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.090
That's not why.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.850
This time I'm here

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.420
to bid you farewell.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.180
I'm going to Chang'an.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.060
Before I leave,

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.610
I want to admit a wrong to you.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.850
This clothing is for you.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.730
I noticed your clothes were patched.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.210
So I bought a new one for you.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.870
All this

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.660
for the salt

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.260
you always sneak off with?

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.780
This fine clothing

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.780
will settle the debt.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.380
So you knew all along.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.690
But this time,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.040
it isn't just because of that salt.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:39.900
What are you doing?

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.140
Because

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.730
I know you're Zhang Mo's father.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.260
And because you knew I was the killer

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.140
yet never blamed me.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.930
You even let me stay here,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.180
letting me work to earn money.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.210
And when I dozed off being lazy,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.660
you covered me with your coat.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.930
You sewed the old family letters Zhang Mo wrote

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.330
into that coat.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.850
When I patched it,

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.090
I learned who you were.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.210
It's fate.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.060
It's truly fate.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.850
If you'd stabbed me a few times,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.180
I might have felt better.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.500
But instead you kept taking care of me,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.780
leaving me ashamed.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.140
I came to Cangshui River

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.500
with hatred in my heart.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.450
Before you came to my salt shop

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.970
to work,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.660
I had already

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.970
watched you for many days.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.020
But I found...

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.450
I found

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.260
you're just a foolish lad.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.730
Always complaining with your mouth,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.210
yet in your heart

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.330
always thinking of others.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.330
Caring for the sick at home,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.330
hoping

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.340
a lost friend

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.600
would show up again soon.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:11.690
You...

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.610
The less you seem like a bad person,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.500
the harder it is for me to hate you.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.090
If only you had never learned who I was.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.660
You did not know,

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.930
and I would not have exposed it.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.090
Day after day,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.850
life could have just gone on like that.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:46.850
Forget it.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.330
It felt as if

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.060
Zhang Mo

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.900
were still here by my side.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.190
You can pour the salt back into the funnel,

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.650
but time cannot be turned back.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.850
I truly wanted to kill you.

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:20.500
But child,

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.740
what use is it if I kill you?

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.640
Zhang Mo will not come back to life.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.300
Zhang Mo

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.890
was ordinary to begin with.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.260
In this world,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.780
nothing is ever that perfect.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.700
Listen well.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:16.850
If you can do something great to help restore the realm,

to support the state,

I am sorry.

Get up.

Remember.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.220
From this day on,

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.940
you must live an honest and upright life.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.090
All right.

Then,

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.410
I will say something unpleasant.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.020
The human heart,

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.850
always has its darkness.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.170
You have it.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.500
I have it too.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.680
But do not be afraid.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.000
No matter how dark it becomes,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.010
just like this Cangshui River,

hold a single light.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.540
All right.

[Zuifeng Tower]

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.690
Mr. Yang.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.920
This street

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:37.980
has suddenly gone quiet.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.700
Have you thought it through?

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.170
What Yan Fengshan

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.610
plans to discuss with the Tiemo people

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.700
is no small matter.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.740
If you stir up trouble now,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.060
kidnap the Tiemo envoy,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.270
and something unexpected happens,

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.110
it is not only Yan Fengshan who will come after you.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.520
Even Tiemo assassins

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.500
will travel all the way to Chang'an

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.620
to kill you.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.320
What Yan Fengshan wants to discuss with the Tiemo people

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.330
is nothing more than persuading them to send troops

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.780
to attack the Baiwenhu Army.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.170
He plans to trade away northern territory,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.490
right?

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.810
The north is Xiao Wuyang's fief.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.060
It is difficult to conquer.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:45.570
So why not give it

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.610
to the Tiemo people

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.980
and let them burn it barren?

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.260
This scheme of Yan Fengshan

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.060
is not hard to guess.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.170
As for my plan,

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.780
I only want the Tiemo envoy

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.740
to meet with me once

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.570
before he meets Yan Fengshan.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.370
After that,

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.750
he can return wholly unscathed

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.090
to Yan Fengshan's side.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.650
You want to negotiate with the Tiemo envoy?

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.700
Can you afford the price?

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.780
Naturally I cannot.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.020
But someone can.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.460
Chen Zhiying of the Huben Army

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.090

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.580
Surprised?

A man who lays the plan

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.260
must step forward himself,

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.130
or else

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.300
who would follow him in?

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.800
But...

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.640
But I heard

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.780
that you do not know any martial arts.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.940
I have a stubborn life.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.410
I am not meant to die yet.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.060
This street is not the same as usual.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.090
Be extra cautious.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:18.850
On guard.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:19.570
On guard.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:32.790
It is fine.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.170
Genghui is here.

All is well.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.740
Then I will send men

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.980
to deal with those ruffians.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.070
Do not send too many.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.610
It is clearly a ploy to lure us away.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.040
You all.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.340
Yes.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:04.700

The carriage is broken.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.440
We should switch to horses.

Very well...

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:17.450
Let go of him.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.460
Let go of him now.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.610
If you do not want your master to die,

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.650
step aside.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:28.500
Tell them to move aside.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:30.850
Stand down.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.330
Fall back.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:38.610
Out of the way!

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.690
You are indeed no ordinary slave.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.170
As long as you cooperate, sir,

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.260
I will not harm you in the slightest.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:05.940
Young man,

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.540
which way is the exit?

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.110
Are you Tiemo people?

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.670
The meteor iron from the altar

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.690
of Mount Shiluoman

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.040
obtained through ritual,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.000
is worn only by Tiemo nobles.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.500
Even if you changed into Han clothing,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.270
the meteor iron on your chest

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.760
is far too obvious.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.370
You know of Mount Shiluoman's altar.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.420
Are you Tiemo people as well?

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.570
Lately Tiemo people are not very welcome

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.370
on the streets of Chang'an.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.830
Explain as we walk.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.600
Can you take me to Yankang Ward?

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:10.700
You will be well rewarded.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.270
There are too many patrols at night.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.630
I dare not

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.720
escort a Tiemo noble down the street.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:22.350
Then take me in for the night.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.720
Send me there at dawn.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.340
Young man,

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:34.510
just for one night.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:36.310
I will not treat you poorly.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.960
Chang'an is so vast.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.590
Why do you live in such a shabby alley?

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.620
For Tiemo people in Chang'an,

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.380
there are not many ways to make a living.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.590
Usually,

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.830
we sell a bit of leather goods,

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.760
which barely keeps life going.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.180
Times are unsettled now,

00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:59.980
so we moved here.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.720
We are almost there.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:03.510
Come on.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.720
Heads means enjoying wealth and honor.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.660
Tails means paying off the debt.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.310
I am Yang Chuhao of the Huben Army.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.590
I greet you, Mr. Wuyin.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:43.200
Do not fear, sir.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.270
You know me.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.070
I know you are Yang Chuhao.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.830
But you cannot appear out of nowhere.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.240
Anyone would be frightened.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.590
Who is he?

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.510
He is with the people who tried to seize you just now.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.110
A linked scheme.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.550
I almost fell for it.

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.590
Sir,

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.350
this place may not be safe.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.640
I should escort you away first,

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.590
then send people to eliminate them.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.650
Good thing you arrived in time.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.270
To protect you well,

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.620
I would give my life without hesitation.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.970
Sir, please.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:16.640
Let us go.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.640
What is this?

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:26.840
Did you bring a blade?

00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.720
No...

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.340
Yang Chuhao.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:38.890
Come.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:39.710
Help me quickly.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:40.510
All right.

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:44.750
So heavy.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.280
[Warrant]

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.360
No.

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.590
All along the way you kept telling me to be cautious.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.760
Chang'an truly is unsettled.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.990
Anyone who can set themselves against the Huben Army...

00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:09.020
is him?

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.680
It looks like...

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.270
Yes, it must be him.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:15.580
This man

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.940
has been wanted by the Huben Army for fifteen years.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.470
Mr. Wuyin,

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:21.560
this time

00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:23.350
you have made great merit.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:25.910
Genghui.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.120
Sir.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:30.350
This is...

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.470
Say no more.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:32.510
Give me the blade.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.390
Since he is wanted by the Huben Army,

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.840
I shall claim this merit first.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.810
Sir, wait.

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:46.390
Sir,

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:49.390
he is Liu Ziwen's son.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.120
He is remarkably gifted.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.310
To kill him would be a waste.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.080
Alive, he is far more useful to us.

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.950
General Fengshan still wants to see him.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.390
Yan Fengshan bears deep hatred for him,

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.310
and has him wanted across the city.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.350
Then take it as my gift to Yan Fengshan.

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.800
Come.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.430
Sir, you were frightened.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:12.350
The carriage is here.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.080
I promise

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.040
that from now on

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.860
you will not be disturbed again.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.080
Please, sir.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:21.660
Carry him away.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:22.450
Yes.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.170
Was this also part of the plan?

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:38.180
I do not know.

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.680
When you read this letter,

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.470
I will most likely have been captured.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:07.390
But do not worry.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.640
The plan is still under control.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:12.910
As for why I arranged this,

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:14.240
first,

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.800
it is for my acquaintance Yang Chuhao.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.240
The old debt he owed has been repaid.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.130
He should not be implicated any further.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.020
By using this plan,

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.850
I can win him

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.510
some time to break away from Yan Fengshan.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.160
Second,

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.200
it is because of Ye Zheng.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.270
Your martial skills are strong,

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:33.830
but you lose your calm when you care.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.870
If you knew the entire plan,

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.820
you would try to stop me.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:42.310
Third,

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:45.340
[Letter]
when the Huben Army captures me,

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.720
the secret I carry

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.510
can draw Yan Fengshan's attention for a while.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:51.720
And that

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.760
will be our best chance to negotiate

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.910
with the Tiemo envoy.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.750
The one going to negotiate

00:36:58.590 --> 00:36:59.950
is already on the way.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.950
This plan may be dangerous,

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.170
[Spring Wind. The Yuan Bird arrives.]

[Thunder stirs. Lightning begins.]
but it is exactly what I wished for.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.910
To confront Yan Fengshan face to face is,

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:50.580
in all my life,
