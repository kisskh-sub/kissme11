00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.479
Three thousand.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.159
And I want you to come with me.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.040
Th-three...

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:10.920
Three thousand one hundred.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.079
Since you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.000
insist on competing with me,

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.000
why not let the young lady
decide for herself?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.799
(I know nothing apart from)

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.599
(sword dancing.)

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.239
(How about this?)

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.280
(If either of you gentlemen)

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.439
(can match the rhythm
of my sword dance,)

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.159
(that would make us a perfect team.)

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.159
(Then,)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.359
(I shall go with that gentleman.)

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.319
(Is that fine?)

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.120
Not bad.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.120
Excellent.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.920
Look.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.239
How did the wine taste?

S-She is the Grand Princess.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.680
She's here to kill us.

Can't you take a loss?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.719
Are you doing it on purpose?

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.280
I suspect

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.719
you've been colluding
with that gentleman.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.240
Please stop arguing.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.120
The Phoenix Pendant

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.000
means nothing to a dying man.

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.000
Why am I on fire?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.479
Let's go.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.639
Help.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.719
- Help.
- Get away.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:18.800
Get away.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.080
(I clawed my way out
from the fiery pits of the underworld,)

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.759
(rising as Sheng Yunfei,
the Sheng family's third daughter.)

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.319
(All I want is to send every evildoer)

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.840
(straight to the deepest underworld.)

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.080
(None of you deserves)

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.960
(to bask beneath the sun.)

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.879
Who are you, Miss?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.000
Master, you spent a fortune on me.

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:52.759
Surely, you already

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:55.879
have the answer.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.240
Am I right,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.439
my mentor?

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.040
The Grand Princess Sheng Yunlin
persecuted loyal ministers

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.600
and harmed the state,

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.240
and the Sheng army was notorious

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.199
for colluding with enemies.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.160
Why would the noble Xie family

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.480
wade into this muddy water?

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:31.839
That's what you think?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.040
Of course.

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:40.199
Grand Tutor, you've
devoted yourself to the state.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.079
Even

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.040
your hair has turned gray.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.480
But back then,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.920
if not for your blunt words,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.480
how would the Grand Princess
have been confined to the Weiyang Palace

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.839
and died in that fire?

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:09.600
Only now do I realize

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.639
that the state I defended

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:18.480
never belonged to the Chen family,

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.399
but to Her Highness.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.519
It's late.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.279
I must rest.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.759
I'll watch over you.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.519
You...

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.040
I'm getting changed.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.959
You may also consider this

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.399
as me asking you to leave.

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:47.879
I will deal with

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.120
what happened.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:52.160
Get some rest.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:17.279
Search every room.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.720
Don't miss a single corner.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.142
(Registry)

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:27.839
Stay put if you want to live.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.360
I must trouble you to sleep with me.

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:38.079
As expected,

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.920
a handsome young gentleman like me

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.160
is simply too charming.

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:46.360
Search every room.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.959
Y-You...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.879
Why are you here?

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.639
That's my question for you, Governor.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.680
Why did you

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.959
barge into my room in the dead of night?

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:13.040
Well...

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.319
I'm here to catch a thief.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.160
Are you saying that

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.079
you've come to my room

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.639
to catch a thief?

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:30.319
(The thief stealing the token to access
the relief funds entered this inn.)

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:34.839
Business is business.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.600
Master Xie,

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:39.199
please allow my men to conduct a search

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.199
to prove your innocence.

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:43.136
(Token)

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:49.199
Master Xie.

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:50.759
My apologies.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.319
Grand Tutor Xie.

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:18.040
I had no idea

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:19.879
you were meeting someone else.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680
Let's see

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:35.639
which blind fool is trying
to ruin my romantic night.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.080
He must be courting death.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.799
Good lord!

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:47.120
Governor Su.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.080
(No wonder
he's nearly thirty and single.)

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.320
(Turns out he prefers men.)

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.240
Have you seen enough?

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.320
I'm leaving now.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.519
Let's go.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.399
Hurry.

00:09:12.039 --> 00:09:13.279
Tell me the truth

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.919
and I'll forgive you for
ruining my reputation.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.279
You care so much about your reputation?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.000
But how am I not good enough for you?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.759
Thieves have honor too.

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:38.840
Here, Miss.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.480
A gift for you.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.600
Sweetheart.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320
We'll meet again.

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.200
I'm off.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.024
(Token)

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:54.399
Oh.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.240
Tomorrow morning,
news of our intimate encounter

00:09:58.399 --> 00:10:00.120
will spread throughout the Chen State.

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:01.320
You mustn't

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:03.360
badmouth me behind my back.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:04.679
Otherwise,

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.320
I'll call you a heartless lover.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:20.519
Why would you hold a woman hostage?

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:22.639
I dare you to let her go.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.360
Take me instead.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.720
At worst,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600
you can stab me.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.720
I'm just a thief.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.840
It's not a major crime.

00:10:43.639 --> 00:10:45.519
Looks like he really cares about you.

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:06.120
Thank you for saving me, my lord.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.759
But I must ask.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.799
Were you trying to save me

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:13.200
or the Grand Princess who
perished in the fire back then?

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:18.039
What feelings do you have

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.200
for the Grand Princess?

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.080
I...

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:32.440
Your Highness, you protected
what you vowed to defend.

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.759
The crumbling Chen State

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.919
was reborn through your efforts.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.120
So why can't you

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.320
come back to live?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.960
Heaven gave you a chance.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.960
It's also a chance for me.

00:12:19.674 --> 00:12:41.856
(Feng Yuan killed his master
and Xue Ruoliu is a traitor too)

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.639
You walk like a ghost.

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:50.840
I didn't hear you.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.840
I didn't want to ruin your moment.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.639
Got the relief fund hidden well?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.320
You can count on me.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.600
Your tactic worked perfectly.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.600
A diversion.

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.639
The officials went after the token.

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:08.039
No one cared about the money.

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:11.879
Su Wei betrayed his master.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.679
Who was Su Wei's master?

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:19.600
I've heard rumors

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.159
that the Regent Princess of Chen State

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.960
had an aide...

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.919
An official must

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:30.279
put the people first.

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.039
Su Wei embezzled public funds.

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:34.039
That's betrayal.

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:37.240
He'll see the money is gone tomorrow

00:13:37.759 --> 00:13:38.799
and do anything

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.759
to keep his position.

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:43.440
Guard the money properly

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.360
just in case.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.320
I'll follow your plan.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.200
But then again,

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:53.600
Lord Xie is quite devoted to you.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.200
To help you,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.840
he even slept with me.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.559
Mind your own business.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.279
Sleeping around

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:01.799
can get you sick.

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:03.159
Don't worry.

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:04.919
I've seen many girls,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.320
but my heart is yours.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.799
At the critical moment,

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.320
I won't fall short of Lord Xie.

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:16.159
Why don't you reveal your true identity

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:18.519
before pledging loyalty to me?

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:20.240
Haven't you known all along?

00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:22.679
Why force my confession?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.960
It's one thing to speculate, and another

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.919
to hear your confession.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.759
It's fine.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.399
If fate permits,

00:14:31.039 --> 00:14:32.080
I will certainly

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.639
tell you everything.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.519
(The Seventeenth Prince of Qi)

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.399
