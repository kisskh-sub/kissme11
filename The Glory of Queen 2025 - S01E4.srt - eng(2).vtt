[Episode 4]

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.580
No!

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.460
Why am I here?

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.220
I saw you asleep on the incense table,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.540
so I brought you here.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.380
You've certainly enjoyed it.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.860
With your posture like this,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.660
does it seem appropriate?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.740
No.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.220
Then why are you still here?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.580
I'll get off you right now.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.060
I'm sorry.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.540
I didn't mean to offend you.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.020
I just had a nightmare.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.740
I think I dreamed about my family,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.620
but I can't even remember

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.500
what they look like.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.580
Actually,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.900
sometimes
forgetting isn't such a bad thing.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.340
The presence of some family members
can be lethal.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.740
Next time you go to the fragrance shop,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.940
could you take me with you?

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.020
Just look at me.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.940
What ill intent could I possibly harbor?

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.460
I only wish to serve you,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.660
tending to your every need.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.660
If it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.020
is coming from you,
I can't believe a word of it.

[Pei's Fragrance Shop]

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.060
Why are you looking around?

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.300
Um... Work habit, that's all.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.860
Now that you know
a number of fragrance ingredients,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.300
I'll test you
on what you've learned recently.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.900
Please go ahead.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.540
Listen carefully.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.540
What's a Fragrance Beast?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.420
The Fragrance Beast
is derived from Beast Charcoal.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.140
You take charcoal powder,
mix in some other ingredients,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.460
and shape it into beast-like blocks.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.140
Then, when you add aromatic herbs,
it becomes the Fragrance Beast.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.220
Why do people today
prefer to burn incense indirectly?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.180
Placing a layer of mica or jade

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.820
between the incense and the charcoal

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.140
reduces smoke

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.740
and allows the fragrance
to disperse more slowly.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.140
This is why fragrance connoisseurs
favor this technique.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.020
This is not mentioned
in the fragrance guide.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.980
Who told you that?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.540
I don't remember.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.620
I just heard someone
talk about it before.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.220
I didn't cheat.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.260
All right.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.780
Then the next question...

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.620
Second Young Master, I…

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.460
My... my stomach really hurts.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.460
I need to use the restroom.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.260
I'll be right back.

Jingheng's dedication
to studying fragrance

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.660
reminds me so much of myself
when I was young.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.900
For a century, the Pei family
has preserved this legacy,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.300
thanks to our continuous research
and refinement.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.620
Jingheng is smart and diligent.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.460
He is indeed commendable.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.100
By the way, any updates on the assassin?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.140
Mother,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.700
I was just about to report to you.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.780
Yesterday, only one servant
brought congee to the assassin,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.860
and shortly after, the assassin died.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.900
I've already questioned the servant,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.580
and he said it was the steward

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.340
from the younger Xiuning's courtyard
who sent the congee,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.900
and that the congee itself
came from the steward as well.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.740
So you're saying I was the one
who had the assassin killed?

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.100
Qingshan, you spent ages investigating,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.180
and now you are just throwing mud

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.180
to hide your own ineptitude?

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.940
Why so worked up, Xiuning?

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.100
I just find
the assassin's death suspicious.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.020
Surely someone wished
to conceal the truth,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.180
so they decided to eliminate him.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.580
Mother,

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.260
this matter
could be either serious or minor.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.640
Perhaps we should report it
to the authorities

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.620
and have the coroner examine the body.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.060
Enough!

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.980
Not only did we fail
to recover the fragrance manual,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.580
but now such a scandal occurs at home.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.460
Do you wish to make us
even more disgraced?

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.500
Mother, you're right.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.020
You may all leave now.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.100
At last, the moment
I've been waiting for.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.380
Be careful.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.220
I must be cursed
to run into you two brothers.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.460
What did you say?

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.060
Nothing.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.740
Second Young Master asked me
to run some errands.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.500
I'll be off now.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.500
Song Zhiyao,

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.420
you've been in the restroom forever.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.020
I thought you'd gotten stuck there.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.020

if this maid isn't to your liking,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.060
I can swap in two
from my courtyard for you.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.780
What do you think?

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.580
I will take care of
the maid's training myself,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.620
so you don't need to worry about it.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.260
It seems this maid isn't to your liking,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.980
which is why she keeps upsetting you.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.220
Since you're not satisfied with her,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.340
there's no need
to make things so awkward.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.900
If word gets out, people will think
the Pei family mistreats servants.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.500
If you don't mind,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.460
let her come to my courtyard.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.460
I actually quite like her.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.780
Did I mistreat you?

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.580
Of course not.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.020
Second Young Master treats me very well.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.420
It's my own fault.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.860
I keep upsetting him.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.380
Jingheng,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.860
I may have no authority to decide,

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.860
but I truly feel for her.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.180
Perhaps we should let her
choose for herself.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.300
I've long wished to avoid upsetting you,
Second Young Master.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.620
Since you don't like me,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.380
I'll go with Eldest Young Master.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.180
Then let's go.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.140
She may not attend to me well,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.260
but her gift for fragrance-making
is undeniable.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.100
I've already taken her as my apprentice.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.140
You should look for someone else.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.020
Let's go.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.700
So, you ran out and got caught
right away. Feeling disappointed?

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.620
I went out to the restroom,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.780
and happened to run into
Eldest Young Master,

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.180
which is what caused the delay.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.380
Eldest Young Master?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.780
Why does he care for you so much?

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.940
How should I know?

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.220
Second Young Master,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.980
Mr. Meng would like to see you.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.820
Measure and pack
these fragrance powders carefully.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.190
Second Young Master asked me
to go to the branch

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.140
to get the fragrance boxes.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.620
Didn't Second Young Master ask you
to pack the fragrance powders?

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.100
Second Young Master said that
right before you came.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.900
Do you dare to question him?

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.500
If you were to delay his affairs,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.540
what punishment would you face?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.180
This pouch is worth a fair sum.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.740
I've managed to escape at last.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:20.940
Now I can go rescue
Ergou and the others.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.020
I wonder how they're doing.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.900
Are you blind or what?

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.980
You...

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.620
These are on sale. Take a look.

They're here.

you'll all pay with your lives.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.220
and only then will I give it to you.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:57.860
Release them.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.460
