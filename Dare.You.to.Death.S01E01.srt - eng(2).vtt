00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:04.025
-You're up next for sure.
-Bell hasn't had a turn yet.

00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:07.985
-You've not done it yet.
-Yeah, you only order others to do it.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.625
-He's next, I'm telling you.
-You're up next.

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:16.465
-Damn!
-Spin it your way now.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:18.145
-Champ!
-Champ!

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:19.625
You're safe now.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.985
So truth or dare?

00:00:27.265 --> 00:00:29.025
Cheers!

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:30.105
Come on!

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:32.145
-I knew it.
-Should have chosen dare.

00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:05.064
Fai.

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:07.705
Fai.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:10.265
Fai!

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:14.665
Fai, what's wrong?
Why aren't you waking up?

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:16.785
Fai!

00:01:17.505 --> 00:01:18.585
Fai!

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.185
Fai!

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:24.185
Fai!

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:25.425
What's wrong with Fai?

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:32.545
Hey, she's not breathing.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.025
Fai!

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:35.785
Fai, don't die!

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:38.025
Fai!

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:39.505
What should we do?

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:40.865
Fai!

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:43.825
Fai, don't die!

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:46.345
Fai, what's wrong?

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:48.025
Don't die. Wake up already.

00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:49.145
Shit! You brat!

00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:51.425
Hey, stop running!

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:52.465
Stop!

00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:05.505
Hands up.

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:07.785
I said, hands up!

00:03:11.145 --> 00:03:14.225
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-It's nothing, bro.

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:15.305
Nothing.

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:24.225
And what's this?

00:03:25.465 --> 00:03:26.465
Vitamin C.

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:28.345
Vitamin C, my ass.

00:03:29.385 --> 00:03:30.665
It's really Vitamin C.

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:33.785
I don't have a weapon.

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:35.585
You'd be breaking the law if you shot me.

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:36.825
Oh, really?

00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:38.225
Shit!

00:03:40.785 --> 00:03:41.745
Don't!

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:43.105
I'll warn you twice.

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.625
If you still don't tell me,

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:47.385
I'll put the third one right in your head.

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:49.465
Don't act like you know the law.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:53.265
Your case allows lethal force
if you threaten us or try to run.

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:54.185
Please don't.

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:56.705
-Three.
-Please don't.

00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:57.905
Two.

00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:01.305
Fine. I'm telling you now. I'm giving in.

00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:05.985
The drugs are from Boss Laem.

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:09.505
They meet every Thursday night
to pick up drugs at Drink Me.

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:10.905
One.

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:18.345
Next time, don't run.

00:04:19.184 --> 00:04:20.265
Damn.

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:22.745
Any more?

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:23.825
Move.

00:04:34.105 --> 00:04:35.665
-Hello?
-Hello, Jade.

00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:39.145
We got a report that some students
were drinking and one of them died.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:40.265
Where?

00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:41.505
Akara University.

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:44.145
-Have the local police arrived?
-They're already there.

00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:46.585
But Commander Don told our team
to investigate.

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:49.305
One of the people at the scene
is MP Ratana's son.

00:04:49.905 --> 00:04:51.825
Commander doesn't want it to blow up.

00:04:52.665 --> 00:04:54.065
Got it.

00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:55.985
You go first. I'll be there soon.

00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:57.105
Roger.

00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:58.865
But the new inspector is coming.

00:05:02.425 --> 00:05:06.265
The one from abroad?

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:12.505
What kind of driving is that?

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:14.305
Hey!

00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:15.465
You!

00:06:15.545 --> 00:06:16.865
Didn't you see--

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:34.185
You're cutting lanes like that.

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:36.025
Do you know that's a traffic violation?

00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:38.945
I'm sorry.
I'm not familiar with the roads here.

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:40.865
-Do you know--
-That's not right.

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:45.145
Not being familiar with the route
isn't an excuse.

00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:50.945
Have you been drinking?

00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:52.305
I haven't.

00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:56.305
Are you done here?

00:06:59.905 --> 00:07:01.545
Not yet.

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:02.905
Hey!

00:07:06.705 --> 00:07:08.345
-Good evening, Captain.
-Evening.

00:07:09.705 --> 00:07:11.665
-Issue me a ticket, please.
-A ticket?

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:14.465
-Thank you.
-All right then.

00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:21.905
Your driver's license, please.

00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:38.825
Mr. Kananon Wiriyasak.

00:07:40.945 --> 00:07:44.385
Officer, what's your name?

00:07:49.705 --> 00:07:53.465
Police Captain Jaruwat Chotsantrakul.

00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:54.425
How much do you want?

00:07:56.385 --> 00:07:59.945
You're trying to bribe an officer,
aren't you?

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:04.185
It's good to see that
this country still has

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:05.625
real law-abiding officers.

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:06.705
You think this is funny?

00:08:06.785 --> 00:08:10.865
You broke traffic laws,
so you must pay the fine accordingly.

00:08:24.145 --> 00:08:24.985
Here you are.

00:08:27.985 --> 00:08:31.705
Next time, don't break traffic laws again.

00:08:53.145 --> 00:08:53.985
Ken.

00:08:54.585 --> 00:08:55.705
What's the situation?

00:08:56.985 --> 00:09:01.185
Eight senior engineering students
were drinking after freshman initiation.

00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:02.745
One was found deceased.

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:06.265
She's preliminarily identified as
Pawarisa Aiyaluk, age 22.

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.945
What about the others?

00:09:08.505 --> 00:09:09.745
Preliminary questioning is done.

00:09:09.825 --> 00:09:12.665
They're being sent to the Investigation
Division for further questioning.

00:09:14.585 --> 00:09:15.465
Captain.

00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:17.305
What is it?

00:09:17.385 --> 00:09:18.865
The new inspector is here.

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:22.265
Didn't you say he'd come tomorrow?

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:25.985
Is he hardworking or just showing off?

00:09:29.665 --> 00:09:32.425
Manmai, photograph every inch of the room.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:33.945
On it.

00:09:34.025 --> 00:09:35.625
Watch it.

00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:37.425
You'll contaminate the prints.

00:09:38.865 --> 00:09:40.345
Got it.

00:09:40.425 --> 00:09:43.225
Where is the foreign-educated cop?

00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:45.505
Over there.

00:09:50.225 --> 00:09:51.505
You two know each other?

00:09:55.185 --> 00:09:56.985
Captain Jade, hello.

00:09:57.585 --> 00:09:58.425
Hello.

00:10:10.345 --> 00:10:13.345
Hello, Captain Jade.

00:10:19.305 --> 00:10:23.265
-Mr. Puth, please rush the results for me.
-Of course, Inspector.

00:10:23.345 --> 00:10:24.825
FORENSICS

00:10:27.945 --> 00:10:31.225
Why didn't you tell me
you're the new inspector?

00:10:31.305 --> 00:10:32.585
You didn't ask,

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:36.625
and I'm not some power-hungry officer
who flashes a badge to everyone.

00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:39.065
But this is good.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.825
Now I can see how your team works.

00:10:41.905 --> 00:10:43.625
I've seen a lot of people like you.

00:10:43.705 --> 00:10:46.545
They all crash and burn in the end, boom,

00:10:47.505 --> 00:10:48.585
drunk on power.

00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:52.225
But I don't arrest people randomly
without evidence.

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:55.905
I perform my duties according to protocol,

00:10:57.265 --> 00:11:01.905
unlike an officer like you
who works without a uniform

00:11:03.545 --> 00:11:04.905
or proper identification.

00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:08.705
This ticket should be invalid, right?

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.865
Initially, the victim's friends said
they were playing a game in the room.

00:11:22.945 --> 00:11:27.025
Then everyone fell asleep.
When they woke up, Puifai was dead.

00:11:27.105 --> 00:11:30.945
Forensics reports the time of death
is under 24 hours.

00:11:31.025 --> 00:11:32.785
Run blood tests
on all the victim's friends.

00:11:32.865 --> 00:11:33.785
Roger.

00:11:39.185 --> 00:11:40.745
So you studied abroad.

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:42.985
Are you as good as those in the movies?

00:11:44.105 --> 00:11:46.585
One look
and you already know what happened?

00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:47.905
Which one is it, Inspector?

00:11:48.745 --> 00:11:52.345
Is it murder or an accident?

00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:54.585
I bet you've watched too many movies.

00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:58.265
I'm not jumping to any conclusion.

00:11:58.785 --> 00:12:01.105
How about we compete in solving this case?

00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:06.025
If I win, I'll be your colleague,

00:12:06.785 --> 00:12:07.825
not your subordinate.

00:12:07.905 --> 00:12:11.745
Why would we turn
the public's suffering into a game?

00:12:11.825 --> 00:12:14.345
Solving cases faster is better, isn't it?

00:12:14.425 --> 00:12:15.665
Why?

00:12:16.425 --> 00:12:18.305
Are you scared to compete with me?

00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:21.425
Or are you afraid you'll lose to me?

00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:24.505
If you want to compete, that's fine.

00:12:25.465 --> 00:12:26.585
But let me warn you.

00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:29.585
I've never lost.

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.345
What a coincidence.

00:12:32.825 --> 00:12:34.465
Neither have I.

00:12:51.025 --> 00:12:52.265
Jay?

00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:56.825
-What are you doing here?
-Jade, I--

00:12:57.385 --> 00:12:58.545
What are you doing here?

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:03.505
Captain, he's one of the seven suspects
in the death incident.

00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:06.905
Please excuse me for now.

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:08.545
What happened?

00:13:09.425 --> 00:13:10.985
-Jade, I didn't do anything!
-Hey.

00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:12.025
Jay!

00:13:15.385 --> 00:13:18.465
Your brother is one of the suspects.

00:13:19.065 --> 00:13:20.585
You shouldn't be working this case.

00:13:20.665 --> 00:13:22.105
Jay?

00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:24.065
How is that possible?

00:13:24.145 --> 00:13:25.105
I won't know

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.865
until I talk to him.

00:13:31.025 --> 00:13:32.225
How about this?

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:35.585
If my brother is involved,

00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:40.305
I'll press charges myself.

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:41.985
You should wait outside.

00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:45.985
I'll question all seven of them.

00:13:52.745 --> 00:13:54.305
And about our competition,

00:13:55.865 --> 00:13:57.545
you can give up now if you want.

00:14:05.185 --> 00:14:08.945
Mr. Jirawit Chotsantrakul.

00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:10.505
You're Jade's younger brother?

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:13.665
Yes.

00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:14.865
Jay, listen.

00:14:16.305 --> 00:14:17.985
Whatever you say,

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:20.065
don't you dare lie.

00:14:20.145 --> 00:14:21.345
Understand?

00:14:25.425 --> 00:14:28.825
You're in the Avengers,
Mechanical Engineering, right?

00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:31.265
It's a nickname people gave us.

00:14:33.105 --> 00:14:34.105
But yes, I am.

00:14:34.705 --> 00:14:36.545
Tell me what happened.

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:38.625
After freshman initiation,

00:14:38.705 --> 00:14:43.065
the eight of us drank
in the faculty storage room.

00:14:43.905 --> 00:14:45.665
We were drinking beer and liquor as usual.

00:14:46.265 --> 00:14:48.265
But Champ wanted to leave early,

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:50.985
so Cherreen and Fai begged him to stay.

00:14:51.065 --> 00:14:53.745
-Took you long enough, huh?
-Quit dragging it out, man.

00:14:53.825 --> 00:14:55.265
Were you playing a game?

00:14:56.225 --> 00:14:57.345
What game?

00:15:02.545 --> 00:15:03.865
Truth or dare?

00:15:05.345 --> 00:15:06.185
Dare.

00:15:12.185 --> 00:15:15.225
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:20.545
We played for a while,
but what confused me

00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:22.505
was everyone started
dozing off one by one.

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:26.745
I remember I was
the last one to fall asleep.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.985
But when I woke up,

00:15:32.145 --> 00:15:33.865
Puifai was already like that.

00:15:34.465 --> 00:15:36.385
You called the doctor first.

00:15:36.465 --> 00:15:38.465
Why didn't you call the police right away?

00:15:39.345 --> 00:15:40.945
We were hoping we could save her.

00:15:41.025 --> 00:15:42.905
So who brought the booze?

00:15:44.065 --> 00:15:44.905
I did.

00:15:45.905 --> 00:15:47.185
But I didn't mix the drinks.

00:15:47.265 --> 00:15:49.505
You're planning to drink it
all yourself, huh?

00:15:49.585 --> 00:15:50.705
Tonkla mixed it.

00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:52.745
Can I say something?

00:15:52.825 --> 00:15:55.145
I saw something weird.

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:56.505
What did you see?

00:15:56.585 --> 00:15:58.865
When the ice ran out
and I went to buy more,

00:16:00.745 --> 00:16:02.545
I saw Cherreen and Champ talking.

00:16:03.185 --> 00:16:04.745
It looked like they were arguing.

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:06.825
Arguing?

00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:16.905
Are these two dating?

00:16:17.705 --> 00:16:18.825
No.

00:16:19.705 --> 00:16:21.345
Champ and Fai were together.

00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:23.985
Cherreen is closest to Fai in the group.

00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:28.025
So you're saying

00:16:28.105 --> 00:16:31.585
Cherreen and Champ argued because of Fai?

00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:32.785
Am I right?

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:36.225
Tell me.

00:16:37.145 --> 00:16:39.665
When you woke up and found Fai dead,

00:16:39.745 --> 00:16:41.825
why didn't anyone call the police?

00:16:41.905 --> 00:16:44.905
You'd better ask Tar and Bell about this.

00:16:50.425 --> 00:16:51.825
Who would've thought that

00:16:51.905 --> 00:16:54.145
drinking could kill someone?

00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:58.625
I wanted to help my friend,
so I called the ambulance first.

00:16:58.705 --> 00:17:00.545
That's all.

00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:04.545
But only Tar and you stopped the others
from calling the police.

00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:05.905
Who said that?

00:17:06.585 --> 00:17:08.985
Honestly, I didn't care.

00:17:09.065 --> 00:17:10.625
They could've if they wanted.

00:17:11.704 --> 00:17:14.944
Tar was the scared one.

00:17:15.025 --> 00:17:16.785
Let's do this, okay?

00:17:16.865 --> 00:17:18.105
He did a lot of drugs.

00:17:18.785 --> 00:17:20.625
No wonder he was scared.

00:17:20.704 --> 00:17:23.825
With everyone passed out,
it could have been Tar's doing.

00:17:24.785 --> 00:17:25.625
That bitch--

00:17:28.065 --> 00:17:32.025
Bell, right?
I know why she didn't want to call.

00:17:32.105 --> 00:17:34.065
She slapped a junior and ruined her face.

00:17:34.865 --> 00:17:38.665
She's brave only because
she thinks she has backup.

00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:40.305
Time's dad is a cop.

00:17:40.385 --> 00:17:41.865
Champ's dad is an MP,

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:44.025
and Jay's brother is a cop.

00:17:44.105 --> 00:17:45.705
You little fucker.

00:17:45.785 --> 00:17:48.385
One more word
and I'll knock your head off.

00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:51.425
I quit drugs ages ago.

00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:55.105
Are you sure you're not using drugs?

00:17:56.065 --> 00:17:57.105
I'm clean.

00:18:04.865 --> 00:18:08.025
Tonkla Parit Kritniwat.

00:18:08.105 --> 00:18:10.465
Your friend said you mixed the drinks.

00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:12.865
Yeah.

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.545
But not when I went to pee.

00:18:18.865 --> 00:18:21.505
Can you recall everything that happened?

00:18:27.225 --> 00:18:29.745
Time and I came to prepare the room first.

00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:35.585
Then Jay, Bell, Cherreen,

00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:39.105
and Tar came later.

00:18:39.185 --> 00:18:43.425
Champ and Puifai arrived last.

00:18:45.385 --> 00:18:48.985
Nothing much happened afterward.
We just kept drinking like normal.

00:18:49.065 --> 00:18:51.185
Then Cherreen and Fai started a game.

00:18:52.385 --> 00:18:55.705
Then Time got wasted first,

00:18:56.225 --> 00:18:58.825
followed by Bell.

00:18:58.905 --> 00:19:00.345
Who do you think did it?

00:19:01.305 --> 00:19:02.225
Champ, maybe.

00:19:03.265 --> 00:19:05.025
He's Fai's boyfriend, right?

00:19:05.105 --> 00:19:09.985
His girlfriend died and he felt nothing?

00:19:13.145 --> 00:19:15.225
Were you and Fai dating?

00:19:15.305 --> 00:19:16.985
Yes.

00:19:17.065 --> 00:19:19.305
We've been together
since our sophomore year.

00:19:21.145 --> 00:19:23.545
Fai was sweet, kind,

00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:26.705
and our families got along well.

00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:31.145
Then why didn't you seem sad
when she died?

00:19:31.225 --> 00:19:32.865
I was probably in shock.

00:19:34.225 --> 00:19:37.945
And I happen to be good
at hiding my emotions.

00:19:38.785 --> 00:19:44.025
Did Fai act unusually before that?

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.945
She took sleeping pills

00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:50.585
and she had stomach ulcers.

00:19:50.665 --> 00:19:51.705
She could barely drink.

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:54.945
Can I go now?

00:19:56.105 --> 00:19:58.945
-Talk to my lawyer.
-No.

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:01.985
Sit down.

00:20:04.265 --> 00:20:06.105
You're one of the suspects.

00:20:06.185 --> 00:20:07.545
Sit.

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.905
Why so many questions?

00:20:14.985 --> 00:20:16.425
How long is this going to take?

00:20:16.505 --> 00:20:17.905
It's such a waste of time.

00:20:17.985 --> 00:20:22.065
CONTROL ROOM

00:20:24.905 --> 00:20:26.825
I'm sorry, it might take a while.

00:20:28.025 --> 00:20:29.265
It's okay, Jade.

00:20:33.425 --> 00:20:35.145
Tell me about Champ and Puifai.

00:20:36.385 --> 00:20:38.105
Champ and Puifai?

00:20:41.265 --> 00:20:42.105
Yes.

00:20:43.465 --> 00:20:47.745
What were they like at the faculty

00:20:49.265 --> 00:20:50.665
and at home?

00:20:51.905 --> 00:20:56.825
Champ is the son of Mr. Ratana,
the district MP.

00:20:58.625 --> 00:21:03.265
He's fun at the faculty.

00:21:10.065 --> 00:21:13.905
He's rich, so he has a lot of friends.

00:21:13.985 --> 00:21:18.305
His girlfriend was Fai.

00:21:18.385 --> 00:21:19.985
They looked happy together.

00:21:20.665 --> 00:21:22.025
They seemed like a good match.

00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:25.345
I heard they'd marry after graduation.

00:21:27.025 --> 00:21:31.345
Did Fai have any medical conditions?

00:21:31.425 --> 00:21:34.505
She always took sleeping pills

00:21:35.985 --> 00:21:39.465
and she had stomach ulcers.

00:21:41.865 --> 00:21:43.945
Fai, slow down.

00:21:44.025 --> 00:21:45.545
You've been sick these days.

00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:48.385
Yeah, right.
If you can't handle it, say so.

00:21:49.265 --> 00:21:50.585
Of course, I'm fine.

00:21:50.665 --> 00:21:52.225
It's the last initiation.

00:21:52.305 --> 00:21:53.465
How could I not be?

00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:55.505
But if anything happens, I'll tell you.

00:21:56.145 --> 00:21:57.585
So I'm not really sure…

00:21:57.665 --> 00:22:01.745
Maybe Fai died because she drank too much.

00:22:01.825 --> 00:22:03.105
On the night it happened,

00:22:03.185 --> 00:22:05.505
when you woke up and saw her,

00:22:05.585 --> 00:22:07.225
what was it like?

00:22:09.865 --> 00:22:14.185
Everyone panicked.

00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:15.905
Once we calmed down,

00:22:15.985 --> 00:22:18.745
Tonkla called an ambulance right away.

00:22:18.825 --> 00:22:21.785
-Who are you to arrest my son?
-Calm down, sir.

00:22:22.705 --> 00:22:24.345
I'm just doing my job.

00:22:25.905 --> 00:22:28.065
Your son was at the scene,

00:22:28.985 --> 00:22:30.265
so I have to question him.

00:22:30.345 --> 00:22:32.105
Then talk to my lawyer.

00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:34.225
Come on, Champ. We're leaving.

00:22:34.305 --> 00:22:36.225
-Wait!
-Calm down, Inspector.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:41.505
My apologies, sir.

00:22:41.585 --> 00:22:43.665
He's new here.

00:22:43.745 --> 00:22:45.825
If there's anything else,
I'll contact you.

00:22:51.105 --> 00:22:52.505
Thank you for your understanding.

00:22:59.305 --> 00:23:00.745
You messed with the right person.

00:23:01.745 --> 00:23:03.785
That kid is MP Ratana's son.

00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:05.105
So what?

00:23:05.985 --> 00:23:07.825
I still want the truth.

00:23:08.385 --> 00:23:10.785
Now that drugs are involved,

00:23:11.665 --> 00:23:13.145
I'll push for the forensic results.

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.945
Already pushing things on your first day?

00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:18.625
We've still got something else to do.

00:23:18.705 --> 00:23:19.825
Like what?

00:23:21.945 --> 00:23:23.705
Taking your brother out to eat.

00:23:34.105 --> 00:23:36.945
Why didn't you tell me Tar and Bell
stopped you from calling the police?

00:23:45.265 --> 00:23:47.505
I didn't want them to get in trouble.

00:23:48.185 --> 00:23:49.545
Why make a big deal of it?

00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:52.625
You're protecting your friends,
but ignoring the dead?

00:23:56.345 --> 00:23:57.785
Are you longtime friends?

00:23:58.745 --> 00:24:02.145
Since freshman year.

00:24:07.585 --> 00:24:10.185
I'm not asking as a cop.

00:24:10.265 --> 00:24:13.505
I'm asking as your brother.

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:22.745
I don't think
anyone did anything to Puifai.

00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:24.945
I trust my friends.

00:24:33.385 --> 00:24:35.425
I don't know any good places around here.

00:24:36.105 --> 00:24:38.505
I just moved back from abroad.

00:24:39.705 --> 00:24:43.065
Where from?

00:24:43.745 --> 00:24:45.945
I graduated in law from the U.S.

00:24:46.025 --> 00:24:49.985
You just moved here
and you're already his boss?

00:24:55.705 --> 00:24:57.585
First day here
and you're already talking big.

00:25:03.105 --> 00:25:04.305
You argue with your friends a lot?

00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:07.425
Arguments happen, of course.

00:25:09.265 --> 00:25:13.065
But the worst fight was…

00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:16.305
between Champ, Puifai, and Tar.

00:25:17.025 --> 00:25:17.985
Tar?

00:25:18.065 --> 00:25:19.345
That dude with glasses.

00:25:22.905 --> 00:25:26.105
It happened after the freshman initiation
in our second year.

00:25:26.185 --> 00:25:28.305
We went to drink at Time's place.

00:25:28.905 --> 00:25:30.025
Tar…

00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:33.545
tried to make a move on Fai.

00:25:35.185 --> 00:25:39.585
He thought she liked him,
that she'd been leading him on.

00:25:39.665 --> 00:25:42.305
But Fai was just nice to everyone.

00:25:42.385 --> 00:25:44.065
She was kind.

00:25:44.785 --> 00:25:47.225
Luckily, Champ stepped in to help,

00:25:47.305 --> 00:25:49.505
and the two of them started dating.

00:25:54.225 --> 00:25:55.665
None of them held that against Tar?

00:25:56.665 --> 00:25:58.225
Champ didn't want us to break apart,

00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:01.865
so he told everyone
to pretend nothing happened.

00:26:02.505 --> 00:26:04.425
Why didn't you mention this
during questioning?

00:26:05.465 --> 00:26:06.305
What's with you?

00:26:06.905 --> 00:26:08.745
Are you hiding something else from us?

00:26:10.465 --> 00:26:11.905
I'm telling you now, aren't I?

00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:15.545
With the way you talk,
who would want to say anything?

00:26:17.025 --> 00:26:20.185
I'm asking you nicely, so just answer.

00:26:28.065 --> 00:26:30.145
Wow, you're dramatic.

00:26:30.225 --> 00:26:31.665
Why did you bring so much stuff?

00:26:32.905 --> 00:26:33.945
I came to work,

00:26:35.345 --> 00:26:36.425
not to fool around.

00:26:41.105 --> 00:26:42.825
Everyone seems to want to mess with you.

00:26:44.585 --> 00:26:45.945
Let me warn you.

00:26:47.265 --> 00:26:48.865
This isn't overseas.

00:26:49.785 --> 00:26:52.625
Here, the one with more allies survives.

00:26:54.785 --> 00:26:56.985
Then go through all the footage.

00:26:58.145 --> 00:27:00.705
Once you're done,
I'll review the forensics.

00:27:00.785 --> 00:27:01.905
Got it.

00:27:02.585 --> 00:27:04.305
But I'm taking a nap first.

00:27:04.385 --> 00:27:05.705
Go ahead.

00:27:09.185 --> 00:27:12.145
Then I'll finally know
how Thai police really work.

00:27:14.145 --> 00:27:16.105
Whether you're Thai or foreign police,

00:27:16.185 --> 00:27:17.705
even if you investigate all night,

00:27:18.225 --> 00:27:19.305
you still need some rest.

00:27:19.385 --> 00:27:22.665
Criminals don't rest,
so why should the police?

00:27:22.745 --> 00:27:26.345
If you're lazy and useless
and keep dragging this case down,

00:27:26.425 --> 00:27:27.985
I'll report you to HQ.

00:27:28.065 --> 00:27:29.585
What?

00:27:30.385 --> 00:27:32.585
-Are you a snitch?
-It's not snitching.

00:27:32.665 --> 00:27:34.345
It's simply reporting facts.

00:27:35.585 --> 00:27:38.705
Try doing something worthy
of the taxpayers' money.

00:27:43.665 --> 00:27:47.545
First case here and it's already
a big one, Inspector Kamin.

00:27:48.145 --> 00:27:50.225
Hello, Commander Don.

00:27:50.305 --> 00:27:55.105
You're aware that one of the suspects
is MP Ratana's son,

00:27:55.185 --> 00:27:57.945
and another is
a high-ranking police officer's child?

00:27:58.025 --> 00:27:59.465
Yes, sir.

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:02.305
I'll handle the case properly.

00:28:02.385 --> 00:28:03.225
No worries.

00:28:06.465 --> 00:28:07.705
There's another case.

00:28:09.105 --> 00:28:11.985
A dealer and a major distributor.

00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:16.145
I expect progress on both cases soon.

00:28:16.225 --> 00:28:17.865
Yes, Commander.

00:28:26.865 --> 00:28:28.985
You're under a lot of pressure, Inspector.

00:28:30.065 --> 00:28:31.105
So?

00:28:32.345 --> 00:28:34.105
Are you going to give up?

00:28:34.185 --> 00:28:36.025
If I gave up,

00:28:37.305 --> 00:28:39.625
I wouldn't be an inspector.

00:29:09.945 --> 00:29:11.185
Don't worry, Inspector.

00:29:12.025 --> 00:29:16.545
No CCTV here and no wiretaps either.

00:29:17.905 --> 00:29:19.465
I cleared them myself.

00:29:19.545 --> 00:29:21.465
That's exactly what scares me.

00:29:29.625 --> 00:29:30.985
Is something bothering you?

00:29:31.705 --> 00:29:33.585
I think these seven kids

00:29:34.785 --> 00:29:36.745
are hiding something from us.

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:42.185
And this one is the worst liar.

00:30:42.265 --> 00:30:46.105
Champ, why did you send me the letter?
What crap are you trying to pull on me?

00:30:47.065 --> 00:30:48.865
I'm sure Tar is on drugs.

00:30:48.945 --> 00:30:51.265
If we find his supplier,

00:30:51.345 --> 00:30:55.585
maybe we'll know
what really happened that night.

00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:02.945
Do you know Drink Me?

00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:06.945
They meet every Thursday night
to pick up drugs at Drink Me.

00:31:09.545 --> 00:31:10.865
Yes, I do.

00:31:16.985 --> 00:31:18.825
We still need the forensic

00:31:19.705 --> 00:31:22.665
and autopsy results
for the Avengers student case.

00:31:22.745 --> 00:31:24.705
I'll switch to this case first.

00:31:24.785 --> 00:31:26.185
Do you normally work like this?

00:31:27.145 --> 00:31:28.345
Like what?

00:31:28.425 --> 00:31:29.985
Solo.

00:31:31.185 --> 00:31:32.465
No consultation with the team.

00:31:32.545 --> 00:31:35.905
And should I be asking how you work?

00:31:42.425 --> 00:31:46.625
It depends on whether
it's a question or an invitation.

00:31:58.225 --> 00:31:59.865
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:32:00.465 --> 00:32:01.945
Two skewers of chicken tail, please.

00:32:03.385 --> 00:32:05.505
Here you go, two.

00:32:17.745 --> 00:32:18.865
You're such a neat person.

00:32:21.025 --> 00:32:22.065
I like things clean.

00:32:26.265 --> 00:32:28.745
You're bringing me to a club now.

00:32:29.705 --> 00:32:30.905
What do we get from this?

00:32:34.185 --> 00:32:36.945
Hey, one bag of sticky rice, please.

00:32:53.785 --> 00:32:55.145
Where did you get these?

00:32:55.825 --> 00:32:57.545
I have my own informant.

00:33:17.305 --> 00:33:18.745
Did you dress to party or investigate?

00:33:18.825 --> 00:33:21.745
You're not dressed
any differently than me, Inspector.

00:33:26.665 --> 00:33:27.745
Welcome.

00:33:29.025 --> 00:33:30.185
Please come in.

00:33:31.345 --> 00:33:32.665
Sure, right this way.

00:33:34.665 --> 00:33:35.905
Have you booked a table?

00:33:36.665 --> 00:33:37.865
Not yet.

00:33:37.945 --> 00:33:40.905
Yes, it's under Jade.

00:33:45.345 --> 00:33:48.465
Welcome.
What would you like for your first drink?

00:33:48.545 --> 00:33:49.985
Sparkling water, please.

00:33:50.065 --> 00:33:51.305
And you, sir?

00:33:52.185 --> 00:33:53.545
Something strong.

00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:58.425
Sparkling water?

00:33:58.505 --> 00:33:59.625
It's soda water.

00:34:00.185 --> 00:34:01.385
Don't you understand English?

00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:04.145
Can you try to be a bit more subtle?

00:34:06.465 --> 00:34:11.065
Babe, don't sulk, okay?

00:34:11.145 --> 00:34:13.145
I just wanted to kiss your cheek.

00:34:18.185 --> 00:34:19.344
See?

00:34:19.425 --> 00:34:21.705
Bro, can you mix it a bit faster? Thanks.

00:34:21.784 --> 00:34:23.744
Thanks. Here you go, babe.

00:34:29.665 --> 00:34:31.025
"Babe"? Seriously?

00:34:32.185 --> 00:34:33.545
You could've played other roles.

00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:35.505
Just go along with it, okay?

00:34:35.585 --> 00:34:37.145
I'm blending in here.

00:34:53.465 --> 00:34:55.304
Do you always wipe tables at clubs?

00:34:57.145 --> 00:34:58.625
I don't drink on duty.

00:35:03.745 --> 00:35:04.905
Hi.

00:35:04.985 --> 00:35:06.105
Mind if we toast?

00:35:09.945 --> 00:35:12.345
Are you two dating?

00:35:13.825 --> 00:35:15.505
What do you think of my taste?

00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:22.105
We're just friends.

00:35:22.185 --> 00:35:24.145
So you're single. That's perfect.

00:35:24.225 --> 00:35:26.185
Join us at the table over there.

00:35:44.345 --> 00:35:45.705
My boy isn't available.

00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:53.985
You think flashing your gun
is a good idea?

00:35:54.065 --> 00:35:56.385
There are a lot of creeps around here.

00:35:57.025 --> 00:35:58.745
I can handle myself.

00:35:58.825 --> 00:36:00.865
If I let you handle it,

00:36:02.225 --> 00:36:03.625
are you sure you can?

00:36:20.585 --> 00:36:21.625
What are you doing?

00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:23.385
Hey.

00:36:23.985 --> 00:36:26.105
If you walk in like that,
you'll get killed.

00:36:26.705 --> 00:36:29.385
Wait until they make the drop
and I'll call for backup.

00:36:49.705 --> 00:36:51.985
-What's wrong?
-That dealer's guy knows me.

00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:54.465
He knows I'm a cop.

00:37:16.265 --> 00:37:17.505
Are they starting?

00:37:19.025 --> 00:37:19.865
They're starting.

00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:30.985
TEAM X: READY TO RAID.

00:37:41.705 --> 00:37:43.185
Pleasure doing business with you.

00:37:43.265 --> 00:37:44.665
Yeah.

00:37:44.745 --> 00:37:46.145
Where's my guy?

00:37:46.225 --> 00:37:47.185
He'll be here.

00:37:50.425 --> 00:37:51.265
Hey!

00:37:52.905 --> 00:37:54.865
Hey! What the hell?

00:37:54.945 --> 00:37:56.025
This is the police!

00:37:56.105 --> 00:37:59.505
You are under arrest
for drug distribution and possession!

00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:03.345
-Shit!
-Go!

00:38:03.425 --> 00:38:04.465
Shoot them!

00:38:04.545 --> 00:38:05.465
-Stop!
-Go!

00:38:06.945 --> 00:38:07.785
Go!

00:38:07.865 --> 00:38:08.705
Inspector!

00:38:09.305 --> 00:38:10.225
Hey! Stop!

00:38:12.225 --> 00:38:13.345
I'll handle it.

00:38:16.585 --> 00:38:17.665
Stop!

00:38:29.225 --> 00:38:30.065
Turn around.

00:38:32.865 --> 00:38:33.905
Turn around!

00:38:43.585 --> 00:38:45.105
Hey!

00:39:02.425 --> 00:39:04.145
Nice aim, Inspector.

00:39:05.785 --> 00:39:06.825
Standard.

00:39:11.745 --> 00:39:12.665
Get in!

00:39:17.945 --> 00:39:20.385
You wrapped up
your first case well, Inspector.

00:39:20.465 --> 00:39:22.105
It was like peeling a banana,

00:39:23.305 --> 00:39:24.905
except you peeled it with a gun.

00:39:38.545 --> 00:39:40.785
TRAFFIC CITATION ISSUED
BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

00:39:40.865 --> 00:39:42.025
What are you doing?

00:39:42.545 --> 00:39:44.585
In case you planned on driving home.

00:39:48.465 --> 00:39:49.825
I didn't even drink that much.

00:39:50.945 --> 00:39:52.585
And I was drinking for work.

00:39:53.745 --> 00:39:54.705
Give me your car key.

00:40:02.345 --> 00:40:03.185
Lieutenant.

00:40:06.105 --> 00:40:07.345
Take his car back to HQ.

00:40:07.425 --> 00:40:08.265
Roger.

00:40:08.345 --> 00:40:09.745
And you, come with me.

00:40:41.985 --> 00:40:43.185
I'm staying here.

00:40:43.865 --> 00:40:44.985
Wait.

00:40:45.985 --> 00:40:48.025
You're staying somewhere
this fancy, Inspector?

00:40:48.105 --> 00:40:49.345
Why?

00:40:50.185 --> 00:40:51.785
I pay for comfort.

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:55.265
Hold on.

00:40:56.625 --> 00:40:59.905
So why did you bring me here?

00:41:02.305 --> 00:41:03.985
Or are you…

00:41:05.225 --> 00:41:07.705
taking me all the way to your room?

00:41:09.225 --> 00:41:10.865
Is that all you think about?

00:41:10.945 --> 00:41:11.905
Well?

00:41:12.945 --> 00:41:14.305
What do you expect me to think?

00:41:25.505 --> 00:41:26.425
For you.

00:41:30.585 --> 00:41:31.545
Thank you.

00:41:36.625 --> 00:41:40.385
What were you thinking
bringing me up here to hang out?

00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:41.985
You like drinking, don't you?

00:41:43.385 --> 00:41:46.945
At Drink Me,
you never put your glass down,

00:41:47.025 --> 00:41:51.425
so I wanted to buy you one
as a thank-you for our first case.

00:41:53.505 --> 00:41:56.425
You know how to say
"thank you," Inspector?

00:41:58.465 --> 00:42:00.265
I don't like owing people.

00:42:01.465 --> 00:42:02.825
Don't worry.

00:42:04.625 --> 00:42:07.265
You should be glad
you've got me as a subordinate.

00:42:07.905 --> 00:42:10.545
I'm the best investigator
in the whole unit.

00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:11.865
That's good

00:42:11.945 --> 00:42:13.985
if you can back it up.

00:42:44.865 --> 00:42:47.745
BOSS, DON'T BE SO HARSH
OR YOU'LL TURN INTO A DOG.

00:42:50.065 --> 00:42:52.945
I'll be in your care from now on,

00:42:53.705 --> 00:42:54.945
Inspector Kamin.

00:43:32.905 --> 00:43:33.785
Hey!

00:43:41.505 --> 00:43:42.545
Are you okay?

00:43:44.465 --> 00:43:46.105
Well, you're standing in my way.

00:43:46.185 --> 00:43:47.705
Of course I bumped into you.

00:43:48.705 --> 00:43:50.185
What? I'm drunk.

00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:54.985
Please, officer.

00:43:55.945 --> 00:43:57.945
Don't tell anyone you work under me.

00:43:58.745 --> 00:43:59.585
I'll be embarrassed.

00:44:02.185 --> 00:44:04.785
Someone like me

00:44:04.865 --> 00:44:07.425
never accepts anyone as my boss.

00:44:09.025 --> 00:44:10.505
But if I ever do,

00:44:11.305 --> 00:44:13.225
it'll only be…

00:44:14.865 --> 00:44:16.385
the owner of my heart.

00:44:20.425 --> 00:44:21.345
Hey!

00:44:24.625 --> 00:44:28.305
I'll drive you home tonight, okay?

00:44:30.025 --> 00:44:32.385
Gotcha!

00:44:33.145 --> 00:44:36.865
Are you thinking something about me?

00:44:38.385 --> 00:44:39.825
Or you can sleep here if you want.

00:44:40.745 --> 00:44:41.585
What?

00:44:41.665 --> 00:44:43.985
Hey! Inspector!

00:44:45.385 --> 00:44:47.505
Wow, seriously?

00:44:47.585 --> 00:44:49.865
You're just leaving a drunk guy here?

00:44:52.185 --> 00:44:53.105
Are you coming or not?

00:44:55.145 --> 00:44:56.945
Okay, fine. Hold on.

00:44:57.025 --> 00:44:58.385
Jeez.

00:45:08.265 --> 00:45:10.105
Hey…

00:45:10.185 --> 00:45:12.265
You even opened the door for me.

00:45:13.505 --> 00:45:14.905
Just hurry up and get in.

00:45:16.745 --> 00:45:17.905
Thank you.

00:45:32.145 --> 00:45:33.505
Watch your leg.

00:45:34.025 --> 00:45:35.785
Are you worried about me?

00:45:38.025 --> 00:45:39.665
Doctor, what do the test results say?

00:45:39.745 --> 00:45:42.345
Based on the results,
I'd consider it a murder.

00:45:43.505 --> 00:45:45.785
Do you think the two of us
can really stop this?

00:45:45.865 --> 00:45:47.505
If we work together,

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:49.825
we'll catch the killer.

00:45:49.905 --> 00:45:51.385
You command people with your mouth?

00:45:51.465 --> 00:45:53.065
Why not?

00:45:53.145 --> 00:45:54.945
My mouth works

00:45:55.025 --> 00:45:56.945
pretty well.
