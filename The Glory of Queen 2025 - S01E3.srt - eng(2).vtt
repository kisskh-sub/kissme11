[The Glory of Queen]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
[Episode 3]

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.340
Aunt, there's no need for that.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.860
Second Young Master, what's wrong?

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.180
Are you feeling unwell?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.300
You haven't recovered from the cold
you caught a few days ago, have you?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.340
Madam?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.460
Then you should go back
and get some rest.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.540
Please excuse me.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.340
Go ahead.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.420
Take care.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.950
Have you known all along

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.580
that there's something wrong
with this liquor?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.740
Watch out!

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.740
Madam, bad news.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.900
Second Young Master has been attacked.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.980
What?

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.580
Are you all right?

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.220
I'm fine.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.380
Jingheng,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.180
are you all right?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.380
You weren't hurt, were you?

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.740
Grandmother, I'm fine.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.420
Who could possibly harm me?

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.780
It's just that I don't know

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.100
how these people got into the manor

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.700
or why they tried to assassinate me.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.900
I need an explanation.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.700
Outrageous!

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.460
Investigate this thoroughly.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.700
I want to know

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.180
who had the audacity
to attack my grandson!

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.940
Mother,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.900
let me interrogate the assassin

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.340
and find out who's behind it.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.540
Qingshan,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.700
you're a man,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.740
You're not suited
to dealing with such matters.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.100
I'll have people
investigate it thoroughly

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.700
and give Jingheng a proper explanation.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.220
Leave it to Qingshan.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.860
As for you,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.180
figure out a way to recover
the fragrance manual, and do it fast.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.260
Yes, Mother.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.460
Xiuning, don't worry.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.700
I will find the mastermind behind this

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.020
and restore peace to the Pei family.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.900
My Lady, please calm your anger.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.700
I know I failed in this matter.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.660
I swear the assassins
will be silenced completely,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.380
no trace will be left behind.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.940
Where is the fragrance manual?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.620
No sign of the fragrance manual
has been found anywhere in the city.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.660
We have eyes posted in every area,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.940
and the moment it turns up,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.020
it will be recovered.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.460
That said, there is an issue.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.060
Speak!

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.580
Right now, our funds are a bit tight.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.580
Just go get it from the Counting Room.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.260
Your monthly allowance has been halved.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.180
If you want more,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.580
I'm afraid

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.980
you'll have to ask
Second Young Master first.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.780
What use

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.220
are you to me?

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.900
Jingheng.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.620
Aunt.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.980
I'm here.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.580
Aunt, Phoenix.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.660
You little wretch,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.780
prepare to die.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.820
All these years,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.820
because Grandmother
has doted on me since childhood,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.860
Aunt has always believed

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.500
I posed a threat to her position
as head of the family,

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.080
[Young Pei Jingheng]
and she has never stopped

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.620
trying to harm me.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.300
Raise your arm higher.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.620
So Father had me learn martial arts
to protect myself.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.100
Second Young Master.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.580
Hang on.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.260
You've been poisoned
and nearly assassinated.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.220
How is your life even harder than mine
as a petty thief?

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.540
Being your maid is way too dangerous.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.860
You'll have to pay me more.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.060
Why did you hit me?

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.900
I'm helping you get your brain working.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.140
My brain's sharp enough.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.060
I don't need your help.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.700
Song Zhiyao,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.980
have you ever been hurt
by someone closest to you?

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.180
Someone closest to me?

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.500
I don't even remember my own family.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.020
Does Ergou count?

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.540
He once stole my meat bun.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.780
It nearly drove me crazy.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.620
Actually, your sense of smell is keen.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.180
You can detect scents most people can't.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.020
With your knowledge of fragrances,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.420
being a petty thief
is truly a waste of talent.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.620
What gibberish are you talking about?

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.340
What are you thinking?

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.660
Do you think everyone

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.780
is born into a wealthy family like you?

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.660
What are you doing?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.580
That was crude.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.220
Crude, is it?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.380
You haven't even seen half of it.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.820
I'll show you what crude really means.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.620
You...

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.620
Song Zhiyao,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.820
would you like to learn fragrance-making
with me?

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.340
Learn fragrance-making?

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.260
It lets you
make the most of your talents

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.620
while giving you a useful skill.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.220
Then I'll have a chance
to go to the fragrance shop with him,

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.820
and I can sneak out
to rescue Ergou and the others.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.020
I'll learn it.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.460
Have a smell.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.060
What a lovely scent.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.980
It has a floral note,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.740
but there seems to be
something else as well.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.740
Based on these fragrance ingredients,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.060

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.300

It's not cool.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.460
Why is it so hot in this room?

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:39.140
Are you not hot?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.460
I don't feel hot. I'm fine.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.220
- It's so hot!
- Not really.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.860
You… you're hot.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:44.780
No, I'm not.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.820
You're hot.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.540
- I really don't feel hot.
- No, you're hot!

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.740
You're hot.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.140
Zhiyao.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.580
You're hot.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.260
No.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.540
Where's Pei Jingheng?

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.060
Wasn't he supposed to teach me
how to make fragrance?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.340
Why is he gone?

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.300
The top priority is to figure out
that one fragrance.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.140
Seems like something's still missing.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.420
I did it. This is the scent.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.540
No!

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.380
