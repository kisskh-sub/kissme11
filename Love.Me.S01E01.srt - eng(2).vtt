00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:04.475
I never really knew what it was like to be lonely.

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:08.445
I guess I never had time to be lonely.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:10.945
Ms. Seo Jun Kyung.

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:12.645
Are you listening to me?

00:01:14.745 --> 00:01:15.745
Yes.

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:20.325
Anyway, I've been feeling especially lonely lately.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:21.625
You know what I mean.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:24.525
It's a void that work and family just can't fill.

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:28.365
I feel women only like me for my background.

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:33.135
Being a lawyer is common now, but I worked hard to get where I am.

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:36.105
So I think I deserve the perks that come with it.

00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:40.845
Aren't you having any?

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:43.175
Right.

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:45.015
Are you uncomfortable?

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:49.245
It is our first time meeting.

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:52.385
We were getting coffee, dinner, and then drinks anyway, right?

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:57.225
That just seems like a hassle, and I don't like to waste time.

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:00.265
I see.

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:02.225
Have I been talking about myself too much?

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:06.595
It's just that I was already told all about you.

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.375
And what exactly were you told?

00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:14.074
You're 36 and graduated from Yonsei University.

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:15.604
You're a doctor at Seah Women's Hospital.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:17.815
Your family consists of your parents and a younger brother.

00:02:18.015 --> 00:02:20.585
Your height is 167cm. Your weight seems...

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:22.845
a bit different from what I heard.

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:28.155
For busy people like us,

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:30.895
coming here to trade resumes is just a waste of time.

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:34.395
Sounds like you did your homework. It saves time too.

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:39.165
How do you know the director?

00:02:39.235 --> 00:02:41.265
We go to the same church. He's older than me, though.

00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:47.545
And he said that given our jobs and our ages,

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:49.775
we'd probably be a good match. So that's why I agreed to come.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.075
But we can tell right away, can't we?

00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:56.755
You're not attracted to me, are you?

00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:01.685
I'm not.

00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:03.655
The feeling's mutual.

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:07.464
I'd rather date someone in their 20s,

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:09.565
but I know that might seem a little shameless.

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:12.665
Besides, it's not like anyone in their 20s would go for me anyway.

00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:18.505
But we both took time to come all the way out here.

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:23.275
We should at least see this through to the end, shouldn't we?

00:03:25.345 --> 00:03:28.015
See if we're compatible or not.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:39.655
I already booked a room.

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:54.975
I see.

00:03:57.515 --> 00:03:58.975
You're saying that you and I...

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:01.915
should have sex?

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:05.755
We just met for the first time today,

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:09.625
- and it hasn't even been an hour. - Look.

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.865
- Could you keep your voice down? - Right. So we won't waste time,

00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:16.835
and we can find out if we're compatible much faster.

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:20.705
Check, please.

00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:22.005
Are you uncomfortable?

00:04:22.505 --> 00:04:23.635
You're being a little rude.

00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:26.705
Judging someone based on their looks is incredibly rude.

00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:28.505
- Your looks? - Then what?

00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:30.945
Is there any other logical reason for what you just said?

00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:33.515
He said you haven't dated for a while.

00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:35.185
And now I see why.

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:37.884
You're the one with the chip on your shoulder.

00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:39.915
If you had better manners...

00:04:39.985 --> 00:04:42.554
or weren't so boring, maybe I wouldn't have acted this way.

00:04:42.555 --> 00:04:45.295
Not that I would have ever slept with you, of course.

00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:49.865
Thank you.

00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:53.395
So there's no point getting to know each other further then, right?

00:04:57.935 --> 00:04:59.775
And for a woman who's not worth getting to know,

00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:02.575
I see even less reason to pay the entire tab.

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:08.085
Put it away.

00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:10.414
You wasted time on a woman...

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:11.514
you were never going to get lucky with.

00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:12.685
Why waste your money too?

00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:14.725
Rude to the very end.

00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:23.595
Are you going on a second date?

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:25.965
Did you turn him down?

00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:29.105
You can tell after one meeting. Why waste time?

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:33.845
What a shame. He's tall and has a sense of humour.

00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:35.545
Plus, he's a gentleman and a big spender.

00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:38.845
A handsome lawyer like that would be a catch for one of us.

00:05:39.575 --> 00:05:41.485
I'm telling you. There's no way he'd be good enough for Dr. Seo.

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:43.185
Dr. Seo.

00:05:43.915 --> 00:05:45.615
Don't ever get married. Okay?

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:47.655
Why bother with all that in this day and age?

00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:52.995
Being single is like veganism. Like this spinach.

00:05:53.695 --> 00:05:57.895
It might be bland, but it's healthy. And you've got to stay healthy.

00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:02.065
(Seah Women's Hospital)

00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:07.275
- So you'll just keep pretending? - Pretending what?

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:10.574
That you're an elegant single woman.

00:06:10.575 --> 00:06:12.315
I'm not pretending. That's the real me.

00:06:12.815 --> 00:06:14.115
- Hello. - Hi.

00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:16.184
Today's special is spicy fried pork.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:17.685
- Okay. - It's good.

00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:23.255
- Who's that? - New nurse at the fertility center.

00:06:23.655 --> 00:06:24.655
She's pretty.

00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:27.095
Everyone's pretty when they're young.

00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:29.395
So true.

00:06:38.475 --> 00:06:39.535
Then again...

00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:44.145
you went and bought a new outfit for your first date in ages,

00:06:44.345 --> 00:06:47.415
only to get a short, balding horn dog...

00:06:47.585 --> 00:06:50.245
who said that even though you were old and not his type,

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:52.754
you should just sleep with him to see if you could be compatible.

00:06:52.755 --> 00:06:54.655
Admitting that you were humiliated on the date

00:06:54.825 --> 00:06:57.595
would be a bit much, wouldn't it?

00:06:58.195 --> 00:07:00.325
The dress and coat? I needed new ones anyway.

00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:10.065
He's a tall gentleman with a sense of humour?

00:07:12.675 --> 00:07:14.375
It's not like he was going to be the father of your child.

00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:17.075
So why sugarcoat it?

00:07:17.515 --> 00:07:20.815
You should've just ghosted him to let off some steam.

00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:23.285
Aren't you the one who always sugarcoats your mother-in-law?

00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:25.855
You say she's the sweetest person and basically paints her perfect.

00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:29.985
Hello.

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:33.425
(OB-GYN Bae Soo Jin, OB-GYN Seo Jun Kyung)

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:36.865
I said I didn't want a blind date. Why was he so pushy?

00:07:37.735 --> 00:07:39.735
Did I do something to piss off the director?

00:07:40.435 --> 00:07:44.575
No. The lawyer must've done something to piss him off.

00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:46.905
(Chief Director Kim Jun Hyung)

00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:53.075
You give up your weekend for a date at some cliche spot.

00:07:53.275 --> 00:07:57.555
If he's tolerable, you get closer. Then once you're close, he meddles.

00:07:57.785 --> 00:08:02.655
Next, you set a date, meet families, send invitations, and have kids.

00:08:02.825 --> 00:08:03.955
Is that supposed to be fun?

00:08:04.595 --> 00:08:06.725
Isn't it all just exhausting and cliche?

00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:08.965
Jun Kyung.

00:08:09.795 --> 00:08:13.935
Even if it's cliche and exhausting, people must do it for a reason, no?

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:18.705
Go on.

00:08:25.545 --> 00:08:28.285
Mommy loves you.

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:37.295
You did a wonderful job.

00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:40.795
- Thank you so much, Doctor. - Thank you.

00:08:43.695 --> 00:08:44.865
She looks just like me.

00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:51.675
Suture.

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.375
Oh, my.

00:09:05.985 --> 00:09:08.385
- My gosh. Hold on. Wait. - What? What is it?

00:09:09.055 --> 00:09:10.525
- What? - It's my phone.

00:09:12.695 --> 00:09:13.695
One second.

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:16.895
- Oh, no! - What is it?

00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:18.535
Time just flies when I'm with you.

00:09:18.795 --> 00:09:21.534
Hey, what gives? You have to finish what you started.

00:09:21.535 --> 00:09:22.735
Where are my socks?

00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:24.435
Just go. Seriously.

00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:27.145
Gosh, I love you.

00:09:27.475 --> 00:09:28.575
I'm sorry. I love you.

00:09:30.045 --> 00:09:32.415
Okay, I'm going. I'll call you. Let's go.

00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:41.324
You're really leaving?

00:09:41.325 --> 00:09:43.955
Yes. I'll call you later. Love you.

00:09:57.675 --> 00:09:58.675
What is it?

00:10:04.315 --> 00:10:05.415
I have a problem.

00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:07.315
What problem?

00:10:07.985 --> 00:10:09.445
The problem is you're too darn sexy.

00:10:12.715 --> 00:10:14.425
Are you serious right now?

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:17.525
- You said you were late! - I don't care. This is on you.

00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:36.245
Who's presenting today?

00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:41.145
What? They're not here yet?

00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:53.325
That would be me.

00:10:54.365 --> 00:10:55.365
I'm sorry.

00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:57.665
Hello.

00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:01.735
Okay, if everyone could please look at the paper I emailed.

00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:03.604
This is a report on the state...

00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:05.135
of the Spanish Culture and Art R and D Fund...

00:11:05.305 --> 00:11:06.775
and an analysis of its key issues.

00:11:07.805 --> 00:11:09.845
- Okay, as you can see... - Excuse me.

00:11:11.675 --> 00:11:13.075
Did you run this through a translation app again?

00:11:15.415 --> 00:11:16.415
Excuse me?

00:11:17.045 --> 00:11:18.314
You're a grad student, not an undergrad.

00:11:18.315 --> 00:11:19.315
You should know better.

00:11:20.925 --> 00:11:21.925
Just don't.

00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:23.525
Okay.

00:11:24.195 --> 00:11:25.195
Go on.

00:11:27.665 --> 00:11:31.495
First, let's go over the background of the fund's establishment.

- Thank you for all your hard work. - I'm so grateful to all of you.

00:11:43.975 --> 00:11:45.845
Sir, I've made the reservation at the restaurant.

You're not skipping out today too, are you?

00:11:47.845 --> 00:11:50.285
It's okay. You guys go ahead and enjoy yourselves.

00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:52.315
But it's Korean beef, sir.

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:56.254
It's not much, but here. Put this toward dinner. Go on.

00:11:56.255 --> 00:11:57.925
Come on, sir. Just join us.

I'm sorry, guys. But I'm so grateful for you all.

00:12:01.965 --> 00:12:04.295
Keep up the great work, everyone. Now, let me shake your hand.

- All right. - Thank you for everything, sir.

00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:09.165
- Here, return this. - Right.

- Thank you for your hard work. - Good luck.

00:12:16.145 --> 00:12:18.645
- Thank you for everything, sir. - You all keep up the good work.

00:12:18.715 --> 00:12:19.775
- Thank you, sir. - Good luck.

00:12:25.455 --> 00:12:26.855
(Handong Administrative Welfare Center)

00:12:26.915 --> 00:12:29.155
He's true to form, right to the very end.

00:12:30.055 --> 00:12:32.295
Look at that. He even had cash ready, so he could skip dinner.

00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:35.625
I wonder what he does for fun. Our boss, I mean.

00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:37.765
I thought he was a great boss, though.

00:12:38.295 --> 00:12:40.295
But still, why did he have to go and resign?

00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:43.435
He was so close to retirement. Such a waste.

00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:44.935
I know, right?

00:13:01.285 --> 00:13:02.555
(Secure-Fit Incontinence Pads)

00:13:04.555 --> 00:13:05.555
Shoot.

00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:07.525
Mint chocolate.

00:13:09.595 --> 00:13:10.595
Right.

00:13:20.005 --> 00:13:22.645
Oh, my goodness! Raphael.

00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:25.015
Is that you? Raphael?

00:13:25.815 --> 00:13:26.975
Yes, hello.

00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:29.484
I haven't seen you at church in ages.

00:13:29.485 --> 00:13:31.385
Funny running into you here.

00:13:31.955 --> 00:13:33.985
How is Julia doing?

00:13:34.455 --> 00:13:38.225
We still pray for Julia at Mass in our parish group.

00:13:39.555 --> 00:13:42.065
Yes, thank you. She's doing much better.

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:44.965
You should stop by sometime. My wife would love to see you.

00:13:45.195 --> 00:13:47.865
She must be doing much better then.

00:13:48.965 --> 00:13:51.535
She almost died, didn't she?

00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:55.375
We all die when it's our time.

00:13:56.905 --> 00:13:59.245
I was so worried.

00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:02.015
- Sorry. I have some shopping to do. - Of course.

00:14:03.745 --> 00:14:06.755
This didn't happen at our parish, but at another one.

00:14:07.085 --> 00:14:10.425
There was a sister in a similar situation to Julia's.

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.525
In the end, she couldn't cope, took her own...

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.695
Oh, dear. She probably couldn't join the Almighty.

00:14:16.895 --> 00:14:18.535
- I'll be on my way. - Okay.

00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:21.235
I can only imagine...

00:14:24.305 --> 00:14:25.435
Raphael.

00:14:26.435 --> 00:14:30.305
It's such a relief to see that you're stronger than we expected.

00:14:31.445 --> 00:14:34.415
I'm not the one who's sick. I'm fine.

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:36.345
You're so strong.

00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:38.285
You're doing a great job.

00:14:38.515 --> 00:14:42.555
The Lord will watch over his little lamb, Raphael.

00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:44.725
We'll be praying for you too.

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:46.225
Yes, thank you.

00:15:01.845 --> 00:15:04.345
"Don't tell me you're skipping dinner again tonight."

00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:08.415
They were all like, "Oh my gosh, we're getting Korean beef."

00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:10.085
They were trying to tempt me with it.

00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:11.485
My gosh.

00:15:12.015 --> 00:15:14.155
My gosh, they can't afford fancy meals like that.

00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:17.695
I feel bad.

00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:21.465
That you're missing your farewell party because of me.

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:26.365
Don't be silly.

00:15:28.265 --> 00:15:31.705
Young folks don't want an old-timer crashing their party anyway.

00:15:36.745 --> 00:15:37.915
Earlier today,

00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:42.885
I dozed off for a moment.

00:15:45.555 --> 00:15:49.825
I saw this brilliant blue ocean right in front of me.

00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:54.365
A white yacht...

00:15:55.895 --> 00:15:58.535
was slicing through the waves.

00:15:59.835 --> 00:16:04.375
I was standing on the bow, with the wind in my face.

00:16:08.475 --> 00:16:11.415
My gosh, what a wonderful dream.

00:16:14.045 --> 00:16:17.985
Wonderful? It's a nightmare, knowing I can never do that.

00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:28.725
What about Jun Kyung?

00:16:29.695 --> 00:16:30.795
Did she call?

00:16:32.565 --> 00:16:34.064
She did. I was surprised...

00:16:34.065 --> 00:16:35.505
she remembered to call, busy as she is.

00:16:37.335 --> 00:16:38.535
Who am I kidding?

00:16:41.175 --> 00:16:42.405
It's not like I don't know our daughter.

00:16:44.075 --> 00:16:46.115
It's food. Open your mouth.

00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:51.285
Say "Ah." Open up. Here it comes. It's going in!

00:16:51.355 --> 00:16:53.285
Hey, don't throw that at your aunt. Goodness!

00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:56.984
- Hey, you guys aren't going to eat? - Isn't it tasty? Yes?

00:16:56.985 --> 00:16:58.124
Where are you going?

00:16:58.125 --> 00:16:59.524
- Look at you eating all that. - Come back here. You'll fall.

00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:00.525
Open up.

00:17:00.995 --> 00:17:03.695
That's it. Just look at you go. It's yummy, right?

00:17:03.765 --> 00:17:06.595
Come here. Don't you dare.

00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:09.065
- Come here and eat your food. - Is it yummy? Look at you.

00:17:09.135 --> 00:17:10.135
- No! - Open up.

00:17:19.675 --> 00:17:22.315
Do you have to mope around all by yourself like this?

00:17:23.285 --> 00:17:25.654
You'll catch your death. Cover up.

00:17:25.655 --> 00:17:27.755
My day started with caffeine and ended with alcohol.

00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:30.155
And just like that, another tedious day is over.

00:17:32.255 --> 00:17:33.625
This is my favourite time of day.

00:17:35.465 --> 00:17:37.195
Right after the day is finally over,

00:17:37.795 --> 00:17:40.695
while Hyung Jun puts the kids to bed and gets some drinks ready,

00:17:41.605 --> 00:17:46.475
this brief moment I have to myself, quiet and alone,

00:17:47.135 --> 00:17:48.705
is just pure bliss.

00:17:51.075 --> 00:17:53.315
You know what's funny?

00:17:53.775 --> 00:17:55.285
I got married because I didn't want to be lonely.

00:17:57.345 --> 00:17:58.615
And Hyung Jun is okay with that?

00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:01.555
Hyung Jun doesn't really have a say in it.

00:18:02.185 --> 00:18:03.955
He's the one who wanted three kids.

00:18:06.725 --> 00:18:08.225
He enjoys it, though.

00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:10.095
Says he's a natural.

00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:14.334
My mother-in-law gives me such a hard time...

00:18:14.335 --> 00:18:15.505
for making her precious son...

00:18:15.835 --> 00:18:17.065
trade his white coat for an apron...

00:18:17.735 --> 00:18:19.175
when I'm a precious daughter too.

00:18:24.205 --> 00:18:25.315
They're finally asleep.

00:18:26.215 --> 00:18:27.475
What'll it be tonight?

00:18:30.685 --> 00:18:31.985
Let's go with the black raspberry wine.

00:18:32.415 --> 00:18:35.155
Right. And for food, it's up to the chef.

00:18:35.285 --> 00:18:37.484
Black raspberry wine and a chef's special it is.

00:18:37.485 --> 00:18:38.625
Sit tight.

00:18:42.825 --> 00:18:43.925
You have a good thing going.

00:18:44.295 --> 00:18:47.395
Of course. I shower him with love.

00:18:48.735 --> 00:18:49.765
Love?

00:18:50.465 --> 00:18:51.475
What?

00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:53.575
Too cheesy for you?

00:18:54.705 --> 00:18:57.575
You have all these people out there,

00:18:57.675 --> 00:19:00.915
so full of love that they're cheating left and right.

00:19:01.785 --> 00:19:05.355
So how can my dear friend, Seo Jun Kyung, be so cold-hearted?

00:19:05.915 --> 00:19:08.355
- Gosh, your arm is heavy. - Hey.

00:19:08.485 --> 00:19:12.955
Love is supposed to be heavy and cheesy, you know?

00:19:14.025 --> 00:19:16.165
- It feels nice, doesn't it? - No, it doesn't, you weirdo.

00:19:16.295 --> 00:19:17.995
Love is a great thing, isn't it?

00:19:18.595 --> 00:19:21.705
("Do You Like Brahms?")

00:19:25.705 --> 00:19:26.775
Enjoy your meal.

00:19:27.475 --> 00:19:28.645
Thank you.

00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:42.885
(Matna Tonkasu)

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:46.295
- Welcome. - Hey.

00:19:47.425 --> 00:19:48.965
You're just eating some dry old pork cutlet?

00:19:49.865 --> 00:19:52.434
- Ma'am, jjolmyeon, please. - Go eat at home.

00:19:52.435 --> 00:19:55.565
Do you know what time it is? My parents ate and cleaned up.

00:19:55.635 --> 00:19:58.275
You should get home earlier. It's not like you're busy.

00:19:58.675 --> 00:19:59.875
I don't want to go home early.

00:20:01.005 --> 00:20:03.444
- I feel like I'm on eggshells. - And we're splitting the bill.

00:20:03.445 --> 00:20:04.875
Come on, buy me a meal. You have a job.

00:20:10.145 --> 00:20:11.914
My team had a work dinner last week.

00:20:11.915 --> 00:20:12.915
I didn't ask.

00:20:14.455 --> 00:20:17.184
First, we had grilled intestines, and for Round Two, we hit a club.

00:20:17.185 --> 00:20:18.195
I still don't care.

00:20:19.295 --> 00:20:20.825
Your girlfriend was performing, by the way.

00:20:21.395 --> 00:20:22.395
You saw Sol?

00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:24.835
All the guys from my office were going nuts.

00:20:25.365 --> 00:20:28.465
That's my Sol for you. Absolutely dazzling.

00:20:28.535 --> 00:20:31.635
A junior from my marketing team went to middle school with her.

00:20:32.035 --> 00:20:33.935
They quickly exchanged numbers that night.

00:20:34.005 --> 00:20:35.145
He said he was going to make a move.

00:20:36.545 --> 00:20:39.375
Hey, that guy only wears designer brands.

00:20:39.745 --> 00:20:41.345
He basically treats his job like a hobby.

00:20:43.545 --> 00:20:46.154
Hey! You see this? Right here?

00:20:46.155 --> 00:20:47.714
It's a symbol of our faith and trust.

00:20:47.715 --> 00:20:49.325
That's disgusting. We're eating.

00:20:51.955 --> 00:20:54.425
See? This is why you're single.

00:20:56.825 --> 00:20:58.765
But weren't you supposed...

00:20:59.295 --> 00:21:01.365
to eat at home today of all days?

00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:03.335
Today?

00:21:04.775 --> 00:21:05.935
Why?

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:10.945
You forgot today was Dad's last day, didn't you?

00:21:13.175 --> 00:21:14.175
Was that today?

00:21:14.245 --> 00:21:16.515
Since you live by yourself, shouldn't you be more caring?

00:21:16.845 --> 00:21:19.015
I get a pass since I live with them and can just see them at home.

00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:22.585
You're freeloading. You're not living with them.

00:21:22.725 --> 00:21:24.185
Call him now before it's too late.

00:21:24.855 --> 00:21:28.395
And just in case you forgot, Mom and Dad's anniversary is Sunday.

00:21:29.225 --> 00:21:31.765
Why is Dad getting us all together for their anniversary?

00:21:31.895 --> 00:21:34.635
I told you. It's for his retirement. We're celebrating two occasions.

00:21:35.735 --> 00:21:37.435
It's on Sunday. Seriously, don't forget.

00:21:43.245 --> 00:21:44.245
What's this?

00:21:44.246 --> 00:21:45.715
Your mom likes mint chocolate chip.

00:21:46.745 --> 00:21:50.245
Make sure to thank your dad for all his hard work.

00:21:50.915 --> 00:21:52.955
And don't be silly and say it came from me.

00:21:53.515 --> 00:21:54.925
- I'm off. Bye. - Thank you.

00:21:54.985 --> 00:21:56.025
Bye.

00:21:58.455 --> 00:21:59.755
(Dad: Jun Kyung, call me when you're off work.)

00:21:59.825 --> 00:22:01.695
Sorry I couldn't call sooner. I was busy.

00:22:02.765 --> 00:22:04.795
Thank you for all your hard work, Dad.

00:22:10.005 --> 00:22:12.035
(Dad: Jun Kyung, call me when you're off work.)

00:22:29.455 --> 00:22:30.625
Gosh, that startled me.

00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:32.255
All right.

00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:33.725
Here you go.

00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:24.074
We're going to set sail today.

00:23:24.075 --> 00:23:25.644
- So we rented a boat. - My gosh.

00:23:25.645 --> 00:23:27.415
- A boat? - Yes. A boat.

00:23:27.575 --> 00:23:29.415
How about we pack lunch...

00:23:29.745 --> 00:23:31.085
and go for a walk in the park tomorrow?

00:23:31.455 --> 00:23:32.455
No.

00:23:33.255 --> 00:23:35.655
Why not? The weather's so nice and warm.

00:23:36.685 --> 00:23:38.395
Watching people strolling...

00:23:39.225 --> 00:23:41.765
and seeing them out and about just makes me feel lonely.

00:23:42.495 --> 00:23:44.765
- Let our tour begin. Let's go. - Let's go.

00:23:45.595 --> 00:23:47.095
I bet this is expensive.

00:23:47.195 --> 00:23:48.234
It is a bit expensive.

00:23:48.235 --> 00:23:49.635
But I have so much time on my hands now,

00:23:50.005 --> 00:23:51.835
and there are so many places I want to go with you.

00:23:52.605 --> 00:23:55.405
That's my point. Who told you to just quit your job?

00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:00.315
It was a waste of time.

00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:10.055
Aren't you...

00:24:11.155 --> 00:24:12.395
sick and tired of me?

00:24:16.695 --> 00:24:17.695
Come on.

00:24:19.465 --> 00:24:20.895
How could I ever be sick of you?

00:24:21.635 --> 00:24:23.135
You're just as charming as ever.

00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:28.405
So you'll go to the park with me tomorrow, right?

00:24:29.205 --> 00:24:30.205
Some other time.

00:24:31.145 --> 00:24:32.275
Right, some other time.

00:24:40.415 --> 00:24:42.185
There's no such thing as next time.

00:24:43.455 --> 00:24:47.825
Guys who just want to sleep with you will do anything to win you over.

00:24:48.165 --> 00:24:49.225
But on the other hand,

00:24:49.365 --> 00:24:51.935
what about the guys who take it slow and get to know you?

00:24:51.995 --> 00:24:52.995
And what are they like?

00:24:53.065 --> 00:24:55.165
They'll take their time, getting to know you...

00:24:55.235 --> 00:24:57.604
and in the end, they'll still do anything to get you into bed.

00:24:57.605 --> 00:25:00.074
My point is, all guys are the same.

00:25:00.075 --> 00:25:04.875
That's why I don't want to date. They're all cut from the same cloth,

00:25:04.945 --> 00:25:06.914
so why waste my emotions on them?

00:25:06.915 --> 00:25:08.715
Seriously? Then why bother going on a blind date?

00:25:10.215 --> 00:25:11.385
That was...

00:25:12.215 --> 00:25:14.114
- part of my social life at work. - Please.

00:25:14.115 --> 00:25:15.555
I can be sociable for work.

00:25:16.355 --> 00:25:18.794
Says the one who bought new clothes and shoes for it.

00:25:18.795 --> 00:25:21.195
She totally got her hopes up.

00:25:21.495 --> 00:25:22.765
That was...

00:25:23.325 --> 00:25:25.594
- just being polite. It was manners. - Give me a break.

00:25:25.595 --> 00:25:26.994
My point is I don't have to worry...

00:25:26.995 --> 00:25:28.304
about being polite and having manners...

00:25:28.305 --> 00:25:30.005
when I'm on my own. It's just easier.

00:25:30.205 --> 00:25:31.265
Look, Jun Kyung.

00:25:32.235 --> 00:25:35.775
- The number one is perfect. - Yes.

00:25:36.375 --> 00:25:38.004
- It's stable. - Yes.

00:25:38.005 --> 00:25:42.015
No surprises. It's all predictable. In fact, there's nothing to predict.

00:25:42.085 --> 00:25:43.085
- But... - That's great.

00:25:43.645 --> 00:25:44.715
It's boring.

00:25:45.785 --> 00:25:49.524
When you add another to make two, that's when things get complicated.

00:25:49.525 --> 00:25:51.254
But it's fun.

00:25:51.255 --> 00:25:53.754
Jun Kyung, think about it. You can't do anything by yourself.

00:25:53.755 --> 00:25:54.824
- Right. - See?

00:25:54.825 --> 00:25:57.825
Just like that. With two people, you can nod along.

00:25:57.995 --> 00:26:00.094
Cheers. You can even make a toast.

00:26:00.095 --> 00:26:02.235
You can even give a compliment, "Gosh, you're a natural at this."

00:26:02.305 --> 00:26:04.205
You can comfort each other and say, "It's going to be okay."

00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:05.275
You can also get into a fight.

00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:08.605
Exactly, you can fight. But you can also make up.

00:26:09.275 --> 00:26:11.345
But then you add 1 more person and become 3.

00:26:11.645 --> 00:26:14.745
Then someone can take sides or break up the fight.

00:26:15.185 --> 00:26:16.315
See? Isn't this so much more interesting?

00:26:17.215 --> 00:26:18.755
Five is a bit much, though.

00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:20.215
What?

00:26:22.685 --> 00:26:24.625
I'm sorry, did you want six instead?

00:26:24.895 --> 00:26:28.165
No. Seven is a lucky number. Honey, we're having black raspberry wine.

00:26:28.195 --> 00:26:30.695
How about we try for twins tonight? Come here.

00:26:30.765 --> 00:26:33.564
Don't you dare lay a hand on me. You must be crazy. Seven kids?

00:26:33.565 --> 00:26:34.834
What are we, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs?

00:26:34.835 --> 00:26:39.074
See, Jun Kyung? Happiness isn't that close.

00:26:39.075 --> 00:26:42.344
It's far away. That's why you have to work for it.

00:26:42.345 --> 00:26:45.875
Isn't the act of trying to be happy a sign that you're unhappy?

00:26:54.755 --> 00:26:56.185
If you actually try,

00:26:58.655 --> 00:26:59.755
do you really end up happy?

00:27:11.505 --> 00:27:12.505
Dad, you're home.

00:27:13.435 --> 00:27:17.145
- You're back. Did you eat? - Yes. What about Mom?

00:27:17.545 --> 00:27:20.445
She's asleep. Maybe it's because they changed her painkillers,

00:27:20.515 --> 00:27:21.945
but she's been getting really tired lately.

00:27:25.585 --> 00:27:26.655
This is...

00:27:27.785 --> 00:27:29.225
for your retirement, Dad.

00:27:30.085 --> 00:27:32.595
Congratulations? Is that the right thing to say?

00:27:33.495 --> 00:27:35.395
Anyway, thank you for all your hard work.

00:27:36.865 --> 00:27:38.895
- You knew about it? - What?

00:27:42.065 --> 00:27:44.205
To be honest, I completely forgot. I'm sorry.

00:27:45.075 --> 00:27:47.505
- Hye On bought it. - Hye On?

00:27:49.175 --> 00:27:50.905
That's so thoughtful of her. What a sweetheart.

00:27:53.445 --> 00:27:55.315
Your mom is going to love this, you know?

00:27:55.945 --> 00:27:58.384
Let's put this in the freezer and we can all eat it on Sunday.

00:27:58.385 --> 00:27:59.385
Sounds good.

00:28:00.515 --> 00:28:02.185
- I'm going to sleep. - Okay. Get some sleep.

00:28:33.085 --> 00:28:34.515
Out of everyone from our year,

00:28:35.325 --> 00:28:37.485
I always thought you'd be the first to get married.

00:28:37.855 --> 00:28:39.025
What makes you say that?

00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:42.925
You don't remember? Remember Kyung Min?

00:28:44.725 --> 00:28:48.235
I have no idea what you saw in that stuffy, clueless nerd.

00:28:48.565 --> 00:28:50.405
You were always chasing after him.

00:28:50.865 --> 00:28:54.335
- You even told him how you felt. - Just to get turned down.

00:28:55.845 --> 00:28:58.245
You confessed your feelings, got turned down,

00:28:58.615 --> 00:29:01.045
and then immediately found someone new to crush on.

00:29:01.545 --> 00:29:04.345
That fearless and amazing Seo Jun Kyung...

00:29:04.945 --> 00:29:05.955
I miss her.

00:29:06.355 --> 00:29:07.655
I was young.

00:29:08.655 --> 00:29:10.455
Come on, I told you to spend the night.

00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:13.595
The population density at your place is too high.

00:29:15.395 --> 00:29:16.395
Hey.

00:29:17.065 --> 00:29:20.635
What can you even do alone? Besides getting lonely?

00:29:22.405 --> 00:29:23.505
Too bad.

00:29:23.765 --> 00:29:28.175
Because I'm not lonely. Not at all.

00:29:28.235 --> 00:29:29.245
Bye.

00:29:46.695 --> 00:29:48.664
Am I the only one who doesn't know this phrase?

00:29:48.665 --> 00:29:50.495
- What? - That's a new one on me.

00:29:51.025 --> 00:29:54.535
Right? I've heard of sayings like "Heads for fish, tails for meat."

00:29:54.595 --> 00:29:57.105
I've heard of that phrase along with her name, Oh Na Mi.

00:29:57.165 --> 00:29:58.605
Oh, that's a good pair.

00:30:19.855 --> 00:30:21.895
- When you're done, do it again. - Okay.

00:30:21.995 --> 00:30:23.725
Keep your composure.

00:30:29.565 --> 00:30:32.335
The Environment Foundation helps companion dogs naturally...

00:30:33.435 --> 00:30:34.534
(Through agility training, )

00:30:34.535 --> 00:30:35.645
(dogs also learn everyday manners.)

00:30:35.705 --> 00:30:38.005
("You and I," Episode 6, Rerun)

00:30:41.745 --> 00:30:44.585
("You and I," From Episode 5 to 6)

00:30:46.755 --> 00:30:48.015
("Men on a Mission")

00:31:17.385 --> 00:31:18.915
Loneliness is a shameful secret.

00:31:20.355 --> 00:31:23.555
A secret that must never be revealed to anyone.

00:31:25.555 --> 00:31:28.965
If by chance, someone tries to look into that secret,

00:31:31.165 --> 00:31:32.865
our defence mechanisms kick in.

00:31:35.405 --> 00:31:37.635
Some of us rush to make excuses,

00:31:38.905 --> 00:31:40.535
some of us get angry,

00:31:42.045 --> 00:31:43.775
and some of us run away.

00:31:46.915 --> 00:31:50.215
Some say loneliness shouldn't be hidden,

00:31:50.415 --> 00:31:51.955
but acknowledged.

00:31:53.055 --> 00:31:55.525
Yet, that's as difficult as facing death.

00:31:57.685 --> 00:32:00.125
That's why we wear flashy clothes,

00:32:01.255 --> 00:32:03.395
put on even more extravagant makeup,

00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:08.505
and meet people with smiles that feign warmth.

00:32:10.865 --> 00:32:13.005
All to keep our shameful secret from being exposed.

00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:19.215
That was a passage from "The World's Many Joys and Sorrows."

00:32:20.645 --> 00:32:23.545
Shall we listen to a song that goes perfectly with this book?

00:32:52.175 --> 00:32:53.545
That'll be nine dollars.

00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:56.515
My gosh.

00:33:02.185 --> 00:33:03.285
What was that?

00:33:09.395 --> 00:33:11.625
- Thank you. - Gosh, you startled me.

00:33:45.225 --> 00:33:46.435
Why are you following me?

00:33:50.535 --> 00:33:52.135
I'm going this way too.

00:33:56.645 --> 00:33:59.315
I suppose I could have run past you...

00:33:59.375 --> 00:34:02.585
or taken the long way around.

00:34:03.885 --> 00:34:05.315
But it's just so cold today.

00:34:07.115 --> 00:34:08.355
I can do that now if you...

00:34:15.265 --> 00:34:16.265
Don't bother.

00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:25.505
- This isn't following you, right? - Gosh, you're startled me.

00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:29.945
See? This isn't following. It's walking together.

00:34:34.415 --> 00:34:36.145
I'm going to drink this with my husband.

00:34:40.615 --> 00:34:41.615
You live in this building?

00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:45.755
Do you live in this building?

00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:53.035
No, I don't live here.

00:35:07.475 --> 00:35:09.645
What's with that new breed of weirdo?

00:36:19.755 --> 00:36:21.315
Who knew I could have fun on my own?

00:36:24.255 --> 00:36:25.925
This is perfect.

00:36:38.135 --> 00:36:41.135
(Golden Tour)

00:36:44.145 --> 00:36:45.145
Excuse me.

00:36:46.845 --> 00:36:48.575
My wife has some mobility issues,

00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:50.485
so travelling internationally is a bit tough.

00:36:51.015 --> 00:36:52.615
So for domestic travel,

00:36:53.555 --> 00:36:55.755
we'd like a destination without too much walking.

00:36:57.655 --> 00:36:58.655
I see.

00:37:02.195 --> 00:37:04.765
If possible, somewhere with no walking at all.

00:37:08.735 --> 00:37:12.305
We do have a place with fully accessible facilities.

00:37:12.575 --> 00:37:15.075
How about a resort on Jeju Island?

00:37:17.105 --> 00:37:18.105
Jeju Island.

00:37:18.205 --> 00:37:21.575
You'll get premium services. How does that sound?

00:37:22.815 --> 00:37:23.845
That sounds great,

00:37:24.585 --> 00:37:25.655
but it must be expensive, right?

00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:28.155
It's the All-Inclusive Full Package.

00:37:29.485 --> 00:37:30.685
What does "inclusive" mean?

00:37:34.695 --> 00:37:36.265
Included?

00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:40.165
- Everything's included. - I see. But...

00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:44.505
we don't need the full package. The basic option is good enough.

00:37:45.675 --> 00:37:49.205
Our premium resort offers a wide variety of packages.

00:37:50.545 --> 00:37:53.044
We have Special Gold, Fantastic Silver,

00:37:53.045 --> 00:37:54.715
and Beautiful Bronze.

00:37:57.645 --> 00:37:58.954
(All-Inclusive: 5,999 dollars, Special Gold: 4,999 dollars)

00:37:58.955 --> 00:38:00.285
(Fantastic Silver: 3,999 dollars, Beautiful Bronze: 2,999 dollars)

00:38:02.355 --> 00:38:05.125
Don't you have anything cheaper?

00:38:05.595 --> 00:38:07.355
Like Normal Copper...

00:38:07.955 --> 00:38:09.365
or something like Simple Brass?

00:38:15.135 --> 00:38:18.135
Take a look, sir. These are special off-season prices.

00:38:19.405 --> 00:38:23.245
We could take off another 20 percent if you remove some perks,

00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:25.745
but if you do, the booking becomes non-refundable.

00:38:25.815 --> 00:38:28.575
We won't be cancelling once we book. We're definitely going.

00:38:29.485 --> 00:38:33.785
This package is perfect for you. Take a look.

00:38:34.955 --> 00:38:37.284
- Is the yacht tour included? - Of course.

00:38:37.285 --> 00:38:41.395
You can opt for a private yacht tour for just the two of you.

00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:55.105
Excuse me, how much is that one?

00:38:56.905 --> 00:38:59.575
This one's 260 dollars. Would you like it?

00:39:00.845 --> 00:39:02.615
No, let me think about it.

00:39:05.345 --> 00:39:06.715
How much is that one over there?

00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:09.985
This one is 180 dollars.

00:39:15.055 --> 00:39:17.725
Okay, then...

00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:20.265
what about this one?

00:39:21.995 --> 00:39:24.105
What's the occasion, if you don't mind me asking?

00:39:26.375 --> 00:39:28.105
It's for a celebration.

00:40:12.115 --> 00:40:13.314
(Steak, potatoes, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, )

00:40:13.315 --> 00:40:14.584
(diapers, ice cream, tofu, dried pollack, onions, )

00:40:14.585 --> 00:40:15.924
(Hamburg steak recipe)

00:40:15.925 --> 00:40:17.055
Has it been...

00:40:17.755 --> 00:40:19.155
37 years?

00:40:19.655 --> 00:40:20.655
What?

00:40:21.095 --> 00:40:24.164
Come on. We must count from the day when we got our pictures taken...

00:40:24.165 --> 00:40:26.235
and signed the papers for our wedding anniversary.

00:40:27.135 --> 00:40:29.935
Let's see. We registered after Jun Kyung turned one.

00:40:30.505 --> 00:40:32.635
It's our 35th anniversary.

00:40:33.775 --> 00:40:38.005
It feels like the time has flown by.

00:40:38.145 --> 00:40:39.815
But at the same time, it feels like it's crawled.

00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:43.845
You think so?

00:40:45.245 --> 00:40:46.985
For me, it only crawled.

00:40:48.285 --> 00:40:49.755
What are you going to wear, honey?

00:40:50.585 --> 00:40:52.025
Just like Jun Kyung said,

00:40:52.755 --> 00:40:55.425
- I should be in a nursing home. - Don't say that.

00:40:55.965 --> 00:40:57.265
Why would you go there when I'm right here?

00:41:00.835 --> 00:41:01.835
Honey.

00:41:02.195 --> 00:41:05.775
How about this one? I always loved it on you.

00:41:07.805 --> 00:41:08.935
That won't fit.

00:41:24.285 --> 00:41:25.385
The problem is,

00:41:26.095 --> 00:41:29.925
I knew it was broken, but I just let it be.

00:41:30.165 --> 00:41:31.425
You should've gotten it fixed.

00:41:31.695 --> 00:41:34.795
You think they can just come the same day you call?

00:41:35.065 --> 00:41:37.665
The technician's schedule has to line up with my day off.

00:41:38.005 --> 00:41:39.805
If it's this hard to see a repairman,

00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:41.135
how can I meet anyone?

00:41:41.635 --> 00:41:43.005
I'm getting off work soon.

00:41:43.075 --> 00:41:44.275
Just do it at my place.

00:41:44.345 --> 00:41:46.575
- There's something I have to do. - Like what?

00:41:48.745 --> 00:41:50.085
Something exhausting.

00:42:00.425 --> 00:42:01.425
No.

00:42:04.095 --> 00:42:05.565
Actually, it's something terrifying.

00:42:07.035 --> 00:42:09.335
If you see a missed call, you're supposed to call back.

00:42:09.635 --> 00:42:11.705
I told you I was going to sleep in after practising all night.

00:42:11.965 --> 00:42:13.835
You were sleeping for so long, I got worried.

00:42:14.905 --> 00:42:16.974
What's there to worry about when I'm sleeping?

00:42:16.975 --> 00:42:20.345
You're so pretty, I get worried guys will hit on you in your dreams.

00:42:21.015 --> 00:42:22.145
Come on.

00:42:23.115 --> 00:42:24.545
Who are you meeting up with?

00:42:24.945 --> 00:42:27.585
Just some friends you don't know. Friends from middle school.

00:42:28.385 --> 00:42:31.155
They're coming to my club show, so we're hanging out after.

00:42:32.385 --> 00:42:33.395
Friends from middle school?

00:42:34.095 --> 00:42:36.425
- Which friends from middle school? - I have another call. Talk later.

00:42:36.595 --> 00:42:39.865
Okay, call me later. You'd better. Love you.

00:42:40.395 --> 00:42:41.395
Okay.

00:42:54.315 --> 00:42:55.315
What's going on?

00:42:57.315 --> 00:42:58.315
What do you mean?

00:42:58.645 --> 00:43:00.515
You can't be on your way out already.

00:43:01.785 --> 00:43:02.885
Mind your own business.

00:43:04.425 --> 00:43:05.425
Come on.

00:43:05.995 --> 00:43:06.995
You're family.

00:43:16.805 --> 00:43:18.534
Don't tell me you were waiting for me.

00:43:18.535 --> 00:43:20.035
Are you crazy? Why would I wait for you?

00:43:20.405 --> 00:43:21.875
Because it'd be awkward to go in alone.

00:43:22.105 --> 00:43:24.075
Who gets awkward around their own parents?

00:43:24.445 --> 00:43:25.645
You're one to talk.

00:43:26.475 --> 00:43:29.844
- I do just fine. - As if. You're only good at dating.

00:43:29.845 --> 00:43:32.415
I don't think I've asked you for money in a while.

00:43:32.815 --> 00:43:34.384
Do I really have to take that from you?

00:43:34.385 --> 00:43:37.225
Don't be ridiculous. I pay for half your tuition.

00:43:38.055 --> 00:43:39.494
Undergrad in Astronomy.

00:43:39.495 --> 00:43:41.555
Master's in Cultural Complex Whatever, was it?

00:43:41.625 --> 00:43:43.295
It's Cultural Convergence, actually.

00:43:43.395 --> 00:43:44.565
So what's the PhD going to be in?

00:43:45.225 --> 00:43:47.934
- Traditional Korean dance? - I'm still figuring out my career.

00:43:47.935 --> 00:43:50.934
You just keep flip-flopping. Can't you stick to one thing?

00:43:50.935 --> 00:43:54.234
We haven't seen each other in ages, and this is the first thing you say?

00:43:54.235 --> 00:43:55.905
Was I wrong about a single thing?

00:43:56.705 --> 00:43:59.375
You think you know everything, don't you?

00:43:59.575 --> 00:44:02.414
People don't just say what's right all the time.

00:44:02.415 --> 00:44:03.685
Even if something isn't true,

00:44:04.615 --> 00:44:06.314
you still tell them what they want to hear.

00:44:06.315 --> 00:44:08.115
And it's kinder to do that.

00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:11.025
On a day like today, you should've suggested we eat out.

00:44:11.385 --> 00:44:13.255
You know Mom hates crowds, don't you?

00:44:13.695 --> 00:44:15.995
Go on, keep pushing Mom's buttons. Seriously.

00:44:27.035 --> 00:44:30.105
There we go. Here. All set.

00:44:31.975 --> 00:44:33.145
There we go. One more time.

00:44:34.045 --> 00:44:36.685
There we go. Perfect.

00:44:37.185 --> 00:44:38.185
Perfect.

00:44:42.385 --> 00:44:43.425
Do you want me to put lipstick on you?

00:44:45.955 --> 00:44:47.325
My hands work just fine.

00:45:06.215 --> 00:45:08.415
What do you think? You look good, right?

00:45:10.915 --> 00:45:12.515
- Honey. - Yes?

00:45:14.855 --> 00:45:15.855
I'm sorry.

00:45:17.485 --> 00:45:18.485
For what?

00:45:20.795 --> 00:45:21.795
For everything.

00:45:24.765 --> 00:45:26.495
You're getting better.

00:45:27.035 --> 00:45:28.435
Everything's going to be okay.

00:45:31.335 --> 00:45:34.635
But don't I smell something burning?

00:45:35.875 --> 00:45:38.005
Oh, no. The sauce. Oh, dear.

00:45:48.155 --> 00:45:51.025
(Jeju Island Trip Voucher)

00:45:55.455 --> 00:45:56.665
Okay, this is all set.

00:45:57.165 --> 00:45:59.565
- Dad, should I put this here? - Yes. Go ahead.

00:46:00.195 --> 00:46:02.705
- After that, add potato slices. - Okay.

00:46:02.765 --> 00:46:03.835
Right there.

00:46:08.235 --> 00:46:10.574
Jun Seo. Hang on. Come here. Grab this.

00:46:10.575 --> 00:46:11.575
Okay.

00:46:12.475 --> 00:46:13.645
Be careful.

00:46:14.215 --> 00:46:15.815
Gosh, it's hot.

00:46:16.885 --> 00:46:17.985
I told you to be careful.

00:46:20.055 --> 00:46:21.085
Okay, that's ready.

00:46:21.915 --> 00:46:23.885
- Here, grab that first. - Okay.

00:46:25.925 --> 00:46:27.225
Dad, do you need some help?

00:46:27.355 --> 00:46:30.365
No, it's okay. We're all done. You just sit tight.

00:46:43.705 --> 00:46:44.705
What's wrong?

00:46:47.615 --> 00:46:49.815
Nothing, it just feels awkward.

00:46:50.945 --> 00:46:51.945
What does?

00:46:55.615 --> 00:46:56.625
My clothes?

00:46:57.155 --> 00:46:58.155
No.

00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:16.745
Mom, do you need anything?

00:47:17.645 --> 00:47:18.775
What would I possibly need?

00:47:19.475 --> 00:47:20.575
It's not like I go anywhere.

00:47:27.085 --> 00:47:28.085
Have you been going...

00:47:28.655 --> 00:47:29.655
to your hospital appointments?

00:47:30.955 --> 00:47:31.955
How's your blood pressure?

00:47:36.665 --> 00:47:37.665
My dear mother.

00:47:38.725 --> 00:47:39.735
Oh, my.

00:47:40.295 --> 00:47:41.535
Aren't you looking sexy today?

00:47:42.695 --> 00:47:45.865
You're such a sweet-talker. I wonder who you take after.

00:47:46.105 --> 00:47:47.675
That must be why I'm so popular.

00:47:48.075 --> 00:47:51.875
You have no idea. My professor's always asking for me.

00:47:51.975 --> 00:47:53.515
It's honestly a pain.

00:48:01.115 --> 00:48:02.985
How have you been?

00:48:05.025 --> 00:48:07.425
At the hospital, you mean? Things are fine.

00:48:08.995 --> 00:48:10.225
When you're young,

00:48:10.525 --> 00:48:12.465
being a doctor can be something to be proud of.

00:48:13.365 --> 00:48:16.334
But when you're older, it's harder for a successful woman to meet men.

00:48:16.335 --> 00:48:17.335
Mom.

00:48:20.735 --> 00:48:22.945
We haven't seen each other lately. Can't we talk about happy things?

00:48:25.375 --> 00:48:27.675
Why? She's not wrong, you know.

00:48:30.215 --> 00:48:31.845
All right. Mom, Dad.

00:48:32.345 --> 00:48:34.585
Happy anniversary.

00:48:37.555 --> 00:48:38.785
Happy anniversary from me too.

00:48:38.955 --> 00:48:43.865
Gosh, you shouldn't have. Seriously. Thank you.

00:48:43.925 --> 00:48:47.295
I'll hire a caregiver, so you can go out with your friends,

00:48:47.495 --> 00:48:48.865
go hiking, and do things like that.

00:48:49.435 --> 00:48:51.935
You've been working so hard lately without any rest.

00:48:54.605 --> 00:48:56.605
What are you talking about? When would Dad have time for that?

00:48:56.945 --> 00:48:58.575
Mom's always here by herself.

00:48:59.245 --> 00:49:00.245
Come on.

00:49:00.575 --> 00:49:03.744
Your mother used to wait up alone until I got off work.

00:49:03.745 --> 00:49:05.045
That was hard on her.

00:49:05.545 --> 00:49:07.855
Isn't it better she doesn't have to? Right?

00:49:10.125 --> 00:49:11.325
Honey, do you remember?

00:49:11.925 --> 00:49:16.195
For our first anniversary, we splurged at a Western diner.

00:49:16.595 --> 00:49:18.364
We ordered the hamburg steak.

00:49:18.365 --> 00:49:20.135
That was our first time trying wine, remember?

00:49:20.295 --> 00:49:23.735
And we couldn't stop laughing at our purple lips from the wine.

00:49:25.205 --> 00:49:26.975
You remember that. Don't you, honey?

00:49:27.705 --> 00:49:28.805
I don't.

00:49:30.705 --> 00:49:33.615
Right, Gosh, it was a long time ago.

00:49:33.975 --> 00:49:37.115
It's ancient history. It was over 30 years ago.

00:49:37.185 --> 00:49:38.815
So of course, you wouldn't remember.

00:49:46.055 --> 00:49:47.055
Here you go, honey.

00:49:49.195 --> 00:49:51.565
I've already had painkillers twice today.

00:49:53.595 --> 00:49:54.595
That's right.

00:49:56.365 --> 00:49:58.365
You can't drink then. Sorry.

00:49:59.165 --> 00:50:00.275
You have it.

00:50:01.805 --> 00:50:03.505
No, I'm not really in the mood for it now anyway.

00:50:05.945 --> 00:50:07.945
Water's the best drink there is.

00:50:08.745 --> 00:50:09.845
I'll have some.

00:50:14.785 --> 00:50:15.785
Do you want some too?

00:50:27.395 --> 00:50:29.295
I should have just died back then.

00:50:31.365 --> 00:50:32.535
Then you...

00:50:33.275 --> 00:50:35.735
wouldn't be stuck drinking plain water.

00:50:36.375 --> 00:50:38.375
You could be enjoying all the wine you want.

00:50:44.815 --> 00:50:47.615
Do you always have to be so morbid?

00:50:54.195 --> 00:50:56.365
I feel like I age ten years every time I come home.

00:50:58.795 --> 00:51:00.035
Why did you say "home?"

00:51:00.635 --> 00:51:01.935
Just say it's me.

00:51:02.495 --> 00:51:05.165
Just admit seeing me is what ages you.

00:51:05.435 --> 00:51:08.074
Mom, you know emotions are contagious.

00:51:08.075 --> 00:51:09.205
Hey, Jun Kyung.

00:51:10.405 --> 00:51:11.405
All right.

00:51:12.805 --> 00:51:17.215
Everyone, let's just stop, okay? How about we all make a toast?

00:51:17.315 --> 00:51:20.015
- Come on, it's a special day. - Is it really that hard...

00:51:20.455 --> 00:51:22.315
for you to celebrate on a special day like this?

00:51:27.395 --> 00:51:30.495
That thing you're doing isn't being considerate.

00:51:30.865 --> 00:51:32.095
You're torturing me.

00:51:38.405 --> 00:51:39.835
- Drink it. - Mom!

00:51:39.905 --> 00:51:41.735
It's okay, Jun Kyung. It's fine.

00:51:42.335 --> 00:51:44.145
All right, fine. I'll drink it. No big deal.

00:51:47.515 --> 00:51:49.945
- Drink all of it! - Mom!

00:51:50.885 --> 00:51:53.355
That's enough. All right.

00:52:05.065 --> 00:52:09.035
Okay, it's time to blow out the candles. All right, hold on.

00:52:09.095 --> 00:52:10.105
Okay.

00:52:33.855 --> 00:52:35.455
Mom, your dress is a little tight, right?

00:52:49.675 --> 00:52:51.845
- Honey. - Yes?

00:52:52.605 --> 00:52:54.715
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

00:52:55.215 --> 00:52:57.615
- I need to lie down. - Right, okay.

00:52:58.015 --> 00:52:59.955
- Okay, I've got her. - No. Dad, I'll do it.

00:53:00.015 --> 00:53:01.715
No, you stay here. I'll do it. Just sit.

00:53:07.555 --> 00:53:08.555
Stay put.

00:53:19.065 --> 00:53:20.835
Are we only supposed to say what Mom wants to hear?

00:53:21.675 --> 00:53:26.145
It was just an unfortunate accident. Thank goodness that she didn't die.

00:53:26.645 --> 00:53:29.615
How long must we be miserable if Mom won't even try to get better?

00:53:29.945 --> 00:53:33.655
- Just don't ruin Mom's day. - She ruined mine too, you know?

00:53:37.525 --> 00:53:40.425
Grow up. Please.

00:53:59.105 --> 00:54:00.745
I knew it. Four is too many.

00:54:07.955 --> 00:54:08.955
Honey.

00:54:10.255 --> 00:54:11.855
Don't be upset. Okay?

00:54:14.295 --> 00:54:17.425
I guess Jun Kyung is right.

00:54:21.035 --> 00:54:22.035
I...

00:54:22.935 --> 00:54:24.635
I should probably lose some weight.

00:54:25.765 --> 00:54:27.735
Even the doctor said I should.

00:54:29.905 --> 00:54:33.475
Okay. But don't push yourself. Take it slow.

00:54:34.015 --> 00:54:35.615
We can do it together, nice and slow. Okay?

00:54:39.615 --> 00:54:40.615
What is it?

00:54:44.655 --> 00:54:45.885
Without you,

00:54:47.525 --> 00:54:50.465
what could I possibly do?

00:54:58.535 --> 00:54:59.705
And without you,

00:55:01.305 --> 00:55:02.675
what could I possibly do?

00:55:09.045 --> 00:55:10.215
I'm leaving now.

00:55:11.315 --> 00:55:12.315
Get some sleep.

00:55:22.655 --> 00:55:23.625
You're leaving already?

00:55:24.725 --> 00:55:25.895
Might as well leave.

00:55:28.435 --> 00:55:30.165
Your mom will feel bad if you just leave like this.

00:55:42.345 --> 00:55:43.345
Some other time.

00:55:56.195 --> 00:55:59.595
- You should go back inside. - Go ahead now. It's cold out.

00:56:00.795 --> 00:56:01.795
Go on now.

00:56:06.205 --> 00:56:07.205
Jun Kyung.

00:56:10.575 --> 00:56:12.605
You haven't been home in six months, you know that?

00:56:13.105 --> 00:56:14.115
Okay?

00:56:19.445 --> 00:56:22.685
Say if your mom and I live for another 20 years.

00:56:24.855 --> 00:56:27.025
The number of times we'll all eat together...

00:56:27.655 --> 00:56:29.725
would only be 40 more times. You get it?

00:56:34.365 --> 00:56:36.265
We just used one up, so that leaves 39.

00:56:37.235 --> 00:56:38.235
Right?

00:56:46.245 --> 00:56:47.245
Come home more often.

00:56:48.175 --> 00:56:49.345
Come eat with your mom more often.

00:56:50.415 --> 00:56:51.415
Okay?

00:56:55.315 --> 00:56:56.315
Okay.

00:56:57.525 --> 00:56:58.525
Go on.

00:57:01.995 --> 00:57:02.995
I'll get going.

00:57:03.365 --> 00:57:04.365
Go.

00:57:57.485 --> 00:57:58.545
Hey, Sol.

00:58:00.985 --> 00:58:01.985
Hello?

00:58:04.255 --> 00:58:05.255
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:10.025
Sol, I think you might've pocket-dialled me.

00:58:11.425 --> 00:58:14.565
- Hey. - Hey, that tickles. Stop it.

00:58:15.835 --> 00:58:18.205
- Is this your erogenous zone? - I told you to stop.

00:58:18.565 --> 00:58:20.435
Oh, my. Your slaps hurt like crazy.

00:58:21.805 --> 00:58:23.375
- Sol. - I said stop!

00:58:23.905 --> 00:58:25.075
- Hey! - That actually hurts.

00:58:25.145 --> 00:58:26.815
- Sol. - Stop it.

00:58:26.875 --> 00:58:27.975
What are you doing?

00:58:56.535 --> 00:58:57.705
Thirty...

00:58:59.275 --> 00:59:00.275
five.

00:59:09.915 --> 00:59:12.785
(Golden Tour)

00:59:22.795 --> 00:59:25.205
I'm not sure how you'll...

00:59:27.135 --> 00:59:29.305
I don't know how you'll take this.

00:59:30.775 --> 00:59:31.775
So...

00:59:33.005 --> 00:59:34.345
in our life together...

00:59:35.415 --> 00:59:37.145
we had our share of hard times, of course,

00:59:38.645 --> 00:59:39.645
but we've also had...

00:59:40.215 --> 00:59:42.055
so many wonderful days.

00:59:43.585 --> 00:59:44.785
So from now on...

00:59:48.455 --> 00:59:49.455
What?

00:59:49.995 --> 00:59:50.965
My gosh.

00:59:58.405 --> 00:59:59.465
From here on out,

01:00:00.775 --> 01:00:01.835
for the rest of our lives,

01:00:02.835 --> 01:00:06.545
let's just be happy together. Okay?

01:00:06.915 --> 01:00:09.345
I love you, honey. Sleep well.

01:00:27.735 --> 01:00:28.735
Honey.

01:00:30.435 --> 01:00:31.535
I'm heading out for a bit!

01:00:34.075 --> 01:00:38.275
Jun Seo, call 911!

01:00:39.275 --> 01:00:40.275
Honey.

01:00:45.245 --> 01:00:46.245
Honey.

01:00:48.615 --> 01:00:49.615
Honey.

01:00:56.255 --> 01:00:57.265
But still...

01:00:59.425 --> 01:01:01.135
I thought there would always be a next time.

01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:09.475
A chance to gift her a big basket of flowers without a second thought.

01:01:10.075 --> 01:01:12.475
Honey, please open your eyes.

01:01:13.615 --> 01:01:16.375
A time to sit side by side on the grass at the park...

01:01:17.745 --> 01:01:19.615
and share a picnic.

01:01:25.355 --> 01:01:26.555
"Good night, Mom."

01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:30.825
A next time to say those simple words.

01:01:36.395 --> 01:01:38.035
I thought we had...

01:01:40.835 --> 01:01:44.175
so many of those ordinary tomorrows left.

01:01:56.755 --> 01:02:01.295
(Love Me)
