(This drama is based on
a true story.)

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.033
(The plot was adjusted
for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:03.033
(We have no intention
to offend any careers,)

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:04.033
(encourage immoral sexual values,)

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.033
(or create a pessimistic disposition
of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:07.866
(We would like to apologize in
advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.500

(Theory of Love)

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.066
About what happened tonight...

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.300
I’m so sorry.

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:31.700
I didn’t mean to.

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.033
Are you going to see Sandy?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.166
Hey!

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.733
April.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.133
I honestly don’t trust this woman.

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:43.100
Is there anything more than
the beautiful words on these cards?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.800
I wanted to ask you something,
Sandy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.400
I don’t just let anyone in.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.433
Only people I trust,

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.100
or those who’ve already been in.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:03.100
Please take care of Tanwa.
He’s a professional.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.433
I told you that I went drinking
and passed out last night,

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.566
but actually...

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.700
I was at a party at April’s.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.433
Do you like her?

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.366
Is that why you made me wait
on my birthday?

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.700
You wouldn’t tell me where you were
or what you were doing.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.266
Is there more that I don’t know?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.033
Where did you get these photos?

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:52.733
I should be asking you

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.133
how you ended up in these photos.

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.200
How would I get them

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.933
if the owner didn’t tell me
where they were?

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:02.933
Sandy, I asked you
to get the polaroid,

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:06.000
not mess with my personal photos.

00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:08.700
You’re embarrassing him.

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.000
Stop it.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
Stay out of it.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800
You said it was nothing.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.066
You told me
there was nothing going on.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.066
- Let's talk at home.
- You told me it was nothing.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:26.033
You said nothing was going on.

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:27.100
Stop it. Why are you upset?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.000
You and Tanwa are not a couple.

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:41.600
You’re not going
to say anything, huh?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.133
Nothing at all?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800
Sandy.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.866
I’m stupid.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.600
I’m stupid for trusting you
and a woman like her.

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:00.133
- Sandy.
- Don't.

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:07.466
You’ll only cause more trouble
if you follow her now.

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:10.000
She’s furious.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.000
I don’t want people
to misunderstand you.

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:16.466
You’ll look bad if you leave now.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:21.866
Don’t humiliate yourself.

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:33.033
Thank you for coming.
See you next time. Bye.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.700
Tanwa.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.233
I’m sorry for taking photos of you
while you were sleeping.

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.633
I like looking at you
when you sleep.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.366
I didn’t mean to cause any trouble.

00:03:58.966 --> 00:03:59.966
Never mind.

00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:04.266
I apologize on Sandy’s behalf

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:07.000
for causing a scene at your party.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.100
I don’t understand

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.800
why she was so mad
when you two are just friends.

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:16.900
So what are you two?

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.033
We’re talking.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.433
Is that so?

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.700
You probably saw a whole new side
of Sandy today.

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:33.900
If it were me,

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.766
I wouldn’t humiliate someone I like
at a big party.

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:40.666
If we had a problem,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.833
we would discuss it later.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.233
Sandy.

00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:19.533
When did you sleep with her?

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:22.233
The night you went
to her party, right?

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.966
The night of my birthday.

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:30.666
Yes.

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:34.866
I’m sorry, Sandy. I didn’t mean it.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.033
When were you going to tell me?

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:39.733
If I hadn’t found out,
when were you going to tell me?

00:05:40.366 --> 00:05:42.966
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn’t know how.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:44.700
- Get out.
- Sandy.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.833
You should go, Tan.

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:48.566
Don’t ever come back.

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:50.833
What do you mean?

00:05:51.633 --> 00:05:52.900
We should stop seeing each other.

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:56.833
I don’t want to keep doubting
whether you’re lying to me again.

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:01.133
Sandy.

00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:04.733
April and I

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.533
are no longer sleeping together.

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.166
Trust me, Sandy.

00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:11.266
I’ve always warned you about her,

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:14.733
but you kept telling me
it was nothing.

00:06:16.133 --> 00:06:17.866
You lied to me.

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:20.200
How could I trust you again?

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:22.066
Get out!

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800
Sandy.

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:36.433
I understand that you’re mad at me.

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:38.866
I didn’t want it
to turn out this way.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:40.733
How about this?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.100
I’ll wait for you to calm down,

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:45.100
and then we’ll talk.

00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:19.400
From that day on, I wasn’t
on the phone with him anymore.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.133
We didn’t see each other every day
like we used to.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.200
His relationship with that woman
made me feel like

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.533
I had never really known him.

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:50.833
Thank you.

00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:54.500
Sure, let’s meet
to discuss the details.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.500
Thank you for thinking of me.

00:07:58.833 --> 00:07:59.933
The photographer?

00:08:01.166 --> 00:08:02.166
Well...

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.300
Let me confirm
if Tanwa’s available for the job.

00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:10.500
I’ll recommend
other photographers as well.

00:08:12.433 --> 00:08:14.400
Okay.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.700
Thank you.

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:21.800
(Tan)

00:08:34.766 --> 00:08:36.066
Why didn’t you answer my calls?

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:41.033
Sandy.

00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:43.866
Are we really going to stop
seeing each other?

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:47.233
I still want to see you
and work with you.

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:50.066
If you don’t want to talk to me,

00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:52.666
we...

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:55.100
we can just talk about work.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.700
All I’m asking

00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:58.900
is that we continue
to see each other like we used to.

00:09:05.433 --> 00:09:06.733
No, Sandy.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.100
Sandy.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.300
I miss you.

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:15.566
I miss you all the time.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.833
Don't cry.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.800
I'm sorry.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.800
Don't cry.

00:10:22.366 --> 00:10:23.366
Are the photos ready?

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:25.433
Is the model ready?

00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:27.200
- Go get the model.
- Okay.

00:10:27.433 --> 00:10:28.833
- Is everyone ready?
- Hurry up.

00:10:35.266 --> 00:10:36.900
Thank you for coming back.

00:10:38.066 --> 00:10:39.100
If you hadn’t,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.300
I wouldn’t know who else
could do this job.

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:46.400
I’m glad that I can help you.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.700
Hey.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.433
So...

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:53.033
are we back to normal?

00:10:55.933 --> 00:10:57.200
What does it mean to be normal?

00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:02.366
If you’re still unsure about me,

00:11:03.733 --> 00:11:04.800
at least

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:08.033
we can go back to being friends

00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:10.533
and take it from there.

00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:16.666
Okay.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.533
Let's go get some food.

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:34.033
What do you want?

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:36.333
Up to you.

00:11:37.466 --> 00:11:39.300
Are you done? Are you leaving?

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:40.633
I wanted to surprise you.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.866
How did you know I was here?

00:11:55.366 --> 00:11:56.433
How could I not know?

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.633
I was the one who recommended Sandy.

00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:03.700
You’re so good at this,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.400
so I recommended you to the client.
No need to thank me.

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:13.900
Are you still mad at me?

00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:20.933
I’m having a party
at my place tonight.

00:12:21.933 --> 00:12:23.533
If you want to come,

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.100
feel free to do so.

00:12:26.233 --> 00:12:27.733
We’re close.

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:29.533
You can come whenever you want.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.766
You can also invite Sandy,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.600
as your assistant.

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:40.366
If you don't have any clothes,

00:12:41.233 --> 00:12:42.333
you can borrow mine.

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:45.033
We’re pretty close, we can share.

00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:49.066
You never go to social parties,
probably don’t have nice clothes.

00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:54.033
I'll get going.

00:12:57.933 --> 00:12:58.933
Sandy.

00:12:59.066 --> 00:13:00.166
She’s probably not free.

00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:04.666
April, please excuse me.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800
Where are you going?

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.233
If you’re uncomfortable,
you don’t have to go.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.666
But I think you should.

00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:35.000
So people don’t think you’re mixing
work and personal life.

00:13:35.566 --> 00:13:36.566
Hey.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.900
Even though April knows
you dislike her,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.033
she still recommended you.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.900
Come on.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.833
April is well known
in this industry,

00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:52.033
and this industry is small.

00:13:52.233 --> 00:13:54.166
Don’t get into trouble with anyone.
Trust me.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.866
We still need her. She can help us.

00:13:56.866 --> 00:13:58.300
Can you honestly not tell

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.233
that she keeps getting between us?

00:14:02.666 --> 00:14:03.833
If you really want to go,

00:14:05.066 --> 00:14:06.100
feel free to go.

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:10.966
Don't be like this.

00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:16.233
I still think you should go,

00:14:16.566 --> 00:14:19.266
so you can be sure there’s nothing
going on between me and her.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.633
Fine. Let me know
if you’re going.

00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:33.233
I have to go.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.700
You can also invite Sandy.

00:15:08.866 --> 00:15:11.166
If you don't have any clothes,
you can borrow mine.

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:14.000
We’re pretty close, we can share.

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:26.333
I'll be right back.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.666
Is the party boring?

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.266
Is that why
you’re sitting alone here?

00:15:41.433 --> 00:15:42.433
No.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.200
I was just thinking
about some things.

00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:45.666
Work.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.800
Is your best friend not coming?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.400
Sandy?

00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:55.733
She's probably tired

00:15:57.133 --> 00:15:58.133
and wants to rest.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.700
Maybe

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:02.666
this industry doesn’t suit her.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.933
Do you want my help
finding a new assistant?

00:16:20.866 --> 00:16:21.866
Were you waiting long?

00:16:43.533 --> 00:16:44.533
Were you having fun?

00:16:45.933 --> 00:16:46.933
How's the party?

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:50.500
Thank you for inviting me.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.633
The party looks super fun.

00:16:52.933 --> 00:16:54.033
It really is.

00:16:58.933 --> 00:17:01.233
Let's have some fun then.

00:17:07.366 --> 00:17:08.366
Cheers.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.500
Tanwa.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.700
Cheers.

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:31.766
Wow.

00:17:33.933 --> 00:17:35.100
So refreshing.

00:17:39.533 --> 00:17:41.900
Tan, I want to dance.

00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:43.166
- What?
- Come dance with me.

00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:45.833
- Please.
- I don't dance.

00:17:46.266 --> 00:17:49.366
You’re at a party.
You can’t just stand there.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.700
Isn’t that right?

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:54.366
Please. Come on.

00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:56.400
Let’s have fun like we used to.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.433
Okay.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.200
Let's go.

00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:04.800
Please excuse us.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.400
Have fun.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Sandy.

00:19:40.633 --> 00:19:41.633
Sandy.

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:44.566
Why are you in this room?

00:19:46.233 --> 00:19:47.233
You’re drunk, aren’t you?

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.100
Come on, let’s get out of here.

00:19:49.366 --> 00:19:51.900
Did you sleep with her in this room?

00:19:54.533 --> 00:19:56.266
We should leave.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.200
Come on, Sandy.

00:19:58.366 --> 00:19:59.366
No.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:02.700
How could you sleep with someone
who came into your life after me?

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600
Why?

00:20:04.866 --> 00:20:06.133
How could you do it?

00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:08.733
How could you sleep with her
on my birthday?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.333
How am I not good enough?

00:20:12.766 --> 00:20:14.333
Am I not pretty enough?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.066
When I dress like this

00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:20.266
and act like this, do you like it?

00:20:21.033 --> 00:20:22.600
Look at me.

00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:24.333
Am I pretty?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.533
Do you like it
when I dress this way?

00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:31.233
Come on, Sandy.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.466
Why?

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.200
Why?

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.533
How could you do this to me?

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.033
How could you sleep with her here
and not with me?

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.500
No, Sandy.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.500
Stop it.

00:20:53.333 --> 00:20:54.333
Tanwa.

00:20:56.233 --> 00:20:57.233
Tanwa.

00:20:59.033 --> 00:21:00.333
How could you do this to me?

00:21:01.433 --> 00:21:04.200
How could you sleep with her here
and not with me?

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.400
Why not?

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.300
- Stop it, Sandy.
- Why not?

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:10.866
Not here.

00:21:11.266 --> 00:21:12.266
Not here.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800
Get it together.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.633
You’re wasted.
What’s gotten into you?

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.200
You’ve never acted this way before.

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:20.800
You’re no longer
the guy I used to know either.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.700
Let's go home.

00:21:23.233 --> 00:21:24.466
You're drunk, Sandy.

00:21:24.466 --> 00:21:26.500
How could you do that?

00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:27.700
Come on.

00:21:28.133 --> 00:21:29.166
Let's go home, Sandy.

00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:30.766
- Let's go. Please.
- No.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.766
- Answer me.
- Sandy!

00:21:33.433 --> 00:21:34.433
Listen to me.

00:21:35.233 --> 00:21:37.400
Get it together.
What's the matter with you?

00:21:42.966 --> 00:21:43.966
Are you really going to do this?

00:21:45.866 --> 00:21:47.433
Fine, up to you.

00:22:15.466 --> 00:22:19.100
Don’t tell me Tanwa is dating Sandy.

00:22:20.133 --> 00:22:22.066
She’s so boring.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.233
Don’t talk about her like that.
It’s not nice.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:31.266
Is Tanwa dating you or Sandy?

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.666
He told me he’s not dating her.

00:22:34.266 --> 00:22:35.600
Really?

00:22:35.833 --> 00:22:37.166
He’s not into her.

00:22:38.566 --> 00:22:40.133
To me,

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.033
Tanwa is my toy.

00:22:42.433 --> 00:22:44.233
I don’t mind sharing him
with others.

00:22:44.533 --> 00:22:45.666
Wow.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.300
Nice.

00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:48.533
Does anyone want him?

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.000
Are you sure?

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.400
Let's go home.

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:58.233
- What's going on?
- Let's go home.

00:22:58.666 --> 00:23:00.300
Wait, I'm discussing work.

00:23:00.433 --> 00:23:01.733
- Let's go home.
- Is the party boring you?

00:23:02.733 --> 00:23:03.800
Are you leaving already?

00:23:04.033 --> 00:23:05.033
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:07.833
Let's go home.

00:23:08.233 --> 00:23:09.233
What's going on?

00:23:10.066 --> 00:23:11.900
I’ll introduce you to everyone,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.400
so they can contact you for work.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400
Sure.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.800
If you want to reach Tanwa
about work,

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.266
you can contact me directly.

00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:23.266
We’re always by each other’s side.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.866
Besides, I take care of everything
for Tanwa.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.466
I was discussing work.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.600
Let's go home.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.900
Sandy.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.266
When I told her
to contact me directly,

00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:54.466
I meant it.

00:23:57.833 --> 00:24:00.500
I’m asking you
to stop contacting her.

00:24:01.433 --> 00:24:02.433
What’s gotten into you?

00:24:02.866 --> 00:24:04.133
Why are you doing this?

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.833
Don’t you trust me at all?

00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:07.333
Like I said,

00:24:07.866 --> 00:24:10.700
the one I don’t trust is her,
not you.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.900
Do you know
what she said about you?

00:24:13.933 --> 00:24:14.933
What did she say?

00:24:14.933 --> 00:24:16.566
She said you’re her toy.

00:24:20.866 --> 00:24:21.866
Hey.

00:24:23.133 --> 00:24:24.666
Do you not trust me?

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800
No.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.500
There’s really nothing going on
between me and her.

00:24:34.633 --> 00:24:35.633
How about this?

00:24:36.333 --> 00:24:39.800
If she contacts me,
I’ll ask her to talk to you.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.700
Is that okay with you?

00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:45.800
- Okay.
- I'll get going.

00:24:47.266 --> 00:24:48.300
Tan.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.533
I don’t want to fight with you
because of someone else.

00:24:52.133 --> 00:24:53.500
I’m just worried about you.

00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:00.766
I know you are.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.500
Thank you.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.966
I don’t want to lose you

00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:07.566
because someone else
got in between us.

00:25:08.733 --> 00:25:10.766
Am I still important to you?

00:25:14.866 --> 00:25:16.400
Yes, you are.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.133
How could you not be?

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.300
Right?

00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:29.133
What are you wearing?

00:25:31.766 --> 00:25:33.000
Do you like it?

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.200
Well...

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.300
I'm not used to it,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.300
but you look good.

00:25:43.933 --> 00:25:44.933
You look like a woman.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.066
But don’t wear revealing clothes.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.900
Okay?

00:25:57.466 --> 00:26:01.100
From now on,
I’ll dress up every day.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.800
We’re done. You can pack up.
The client has canceled.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.400
Hurry up.

00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:33.733
What’s going on? Why are you telling
my people to pack up?

00:26:34.633 --> 00:26:35.633
What time is it?

00:26:35.966 --> 00:26:37.566
Why weren’t you on time?

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.166
I’m on time.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.200
I already told you

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.733
the client wanted to start
a few hours earlier.

00:26:43.933 --> 00:26:46.066
The client is furious
and has canceled the gig.

00:26:47.066 --> 00:26:48.066
What?

00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:50.266
You didn’t tell me.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.866
I called you.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.066
The client has been waiting
for hours.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.900
They’re furious
and hired someone else.

00:26:58.533 --> 00:26:59.966
You didn’t call me at all.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.233
If you had,
I would’ve seen it.

00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:04.700
I never make mistakes.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.066
Hold on.

00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:08.733
Sandy.

00:27:09.733 --> 00:27:10.733
I'll talk to her.

00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:14.700
Why didn’t you call me?
I would’ve come right away.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.766
Tanwa, you told me

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.166
to contact your assistant
about work.

00:27:21.533 --> 00:27:25.033
She wasn’t being professional.
You left me no choice.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.933
You did this on purpose, didn’t you?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.500
- You’re crazy.
- Stop it.

00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:30.766
No one jokes around
about something like this.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.033
Stop blaming other people
and start blaming yourself.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.833
You're unprofessional.

00:27:36.333 --> 00:27:39.033
Unprofessional, huh?

00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:40.566
Unprofessional?

00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:42.200
Sandy!

00:27:42.633 --> 00:27:44.133
- That's enough.
- Tan.

00:27:44.366 --> 00:27:45.366
- Let go.
- No.

00:27:45.666 --> 00:27:47.366
- Let go of me.
- Stop.

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:50.500
Don’t you see
that she did this on purpose?

00:27:50.766 --> 00:27:52.066
Sandy.

00:27:52.866 --> 00:27:54.033
Do you see now

00:27:54.433 --> 00:27:57.000
that she’s unprofessional at work
and has anger management issues?

00:27:58.266 --> 00:28:00.866
Tanwa, get it together.

00:28:01.833 --> 00:28:03.333
I won’t tell anyone about this.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.600
If other people find out,
your career is over.

00:28:07.533 --> 00:28:08.533
Get out!

00:28:08.666 --> 00:28:10.500
Who do you think you are?

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.266
- No, Sandy.
- You think you can do anything?

00:28:12.266 --> 00:28:14.333
- Please, Sandy.
- Let go.

00:28:14.666 --> 00:28:16.400
- Let go of me.
- Come here.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.700
- Let go. Who do you think you are?
- Come on.

00:28:22.233 --> 00:28:24.433
- Stop it!
- Let go of me.

00:28:24.766 --> 00:28:25.766
Let go!

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.200
Sandy!

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.500
Why did you do that?

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.000
She jeopardized my work.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.333
Why would she do that?

00:28:34.766 --> 00:28:36.700
If she did,
she would lose her credibility too.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I know she did it on purpose.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.666
But you had no right to hurt her.

00:28:42.366 --> 00:28:43.533
Do you know that you’ve changed?

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.066
Do you know

00:28:45.233 --> 00:28:47.466
how much you’ve changed
since you met her?

00:28:47.566 --> 00:28:49.100
Why are you only criticizing me?

00:28:49.333 --> 00:28:50.933
Why aren’t you defending me?

00:28:53.933 --> 00:28:55.366
Are you afraid to do anything

00:28:56.833 --> 00:28:58.433
because you’re afraid
she won’t give you more work?

00:29:00.166 --> 00:29:01.933
Or have you fallen for her?

00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:03.533
This has nothing to do with her.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.433
I don’t like how you behaved.

00:29:07.033 --> 00:29:08.633
You’re no longer the person I knew.

00:29:09.233 --> 00:29:12.633
What you did made me feel like
you’ve changed.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.400
The way you act
makes me feel like you’re immature.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.766
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

00:29:22.766 --> 00:29:25.266
I should have let you go
live your life,

00:29:25.566 --> 00:29:26.800
so you would have grown up.

00:29:29.733 --> 00:29:31.066
What do you mean?

00:29:34.033 --> 00:29:35.600
Are you breaking up with me?

00:29:35.866 --> 00:29:38.300
What? We’re not even a couple.

00:29:48.966 --> 00:29:50.666
Do you realize what you just said?

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.700
Do you realize what you just said?

00:29:55.866 --> 00:29:56.866
I'm sorry.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.800
But if you continue to act this way,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.466
we should go our separate ways.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.300
Tan.

00:30:13.666 --> 00:30:15.000
If you walk away,

00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:17.533
then we'll no longer see each other.

00:31:39.333 --> 00:31:40.333
I...

00:31:44.833 --> 00:31:46.266
I'm sorry about today.

00:31:48.133 --> 00:31:49.466
You made the right decision

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.600
to come back to me.

00:32:02.233 --> 00:32:03.900
Being with an immature woman

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.800
will only cause you trouble.

00:32:12.166 --> 00:32:13.966
The only one who can create a future
for you

00:32:15.766 --> 00:32:16.766
is me.

00:32:32.866 --> 00:32:34.200
You just came to apologize, right?

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.066
If you’re done,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.100
you can leave.

00:33:09.166 --> 00:33:11.633
(Happy Birthday)

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.266
(Happy Birthday)

00:34:44.233 --> 00:34:45.400
(Happy Birthday.
Wishing you all the happiness.)

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.666
(Another birthday with no gift,
just this card and wishes. Tanwa)

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.433
We never met again after that day,
Aoy and Chod.

00:34:57.366 --> 00:35:01.200
(December, 2024)

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.300
Tan entered a new social circle.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.866
Maybe that was what he had
always wanted, but I didn’t know.

00:35:08.166 --> 00:35:12.166
The longer we stayed apart,
the more of a stranger he became.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.900
Happy birthday.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.000
(Tan)

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.466
(Happy birthday.)

00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:21.166
Hello?

00:36:24.066 --> 00:36:25.766
You want to change the photographer?

00:36:29.033 --> 00:36:33.800
You have chosen a new one?

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.566
Who’s the photographer?

00:36:38.066 --> 00:36:40.033
Is the new photographer here yet?

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.933
I got here a while ago.

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:45.000
Everything is ready.

00:36:45.633 --> 00:36:47.266
I was on the phone earlier.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.466
Hello, Miss Sandy. I'm Sun.

00:36:50.866 --> 00:36:51.866
Hello, Sun.

00:36:52.766 --> 00:36:54.933
You can just call me Sandy.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.066
Sure.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.300
Do you mind being my model?

00:37:00.566 --> 00:37:01.733
I want to test the lighting.

00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:04.966
Me?

00:37:05.433 --> 00:37:07.633
I just want to make sure

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.866
that the lighting works
on a beautiful model.

00:37:13.066 --> 00:37:15.800
Fine, I'll do it.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600
Well...

00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:19.466
What should I do?

00:37:19.866 --> 00:37:22.133
Please stand here.

00:37:22.966 --> 00:37:24.266
- Give me the camera.
- Sure.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.366
Just stand still.
Let me test the lighting.

00:37:31.366 --> 00:37:34.066
Please turn 45 degrees to the side.

00:37:34.333 --> 00:37:35.333
Okay.

00:37:36.433 --> 00:37:37.433
Excuse me.

00:37:50.066 --> 00:37:52.233
I don't want your hair
to block your face.

00:37:57.766 --> 00:37:58.766
Beautiful.

00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:08.666
Sandy.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.300
Sandy.

00:38:12.533 --> 00:38:13.533
Sandy.

00:38:14.666 --> 00:38:17.400
- I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.266
I'm fine.

00:38:20.466 --> 00:38:21.633
Is the photo okay?

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.800
It's beautiful. Have a look.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.200
This one's nice too.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.266
The lighting's great.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.700
And you are

00:38:35.633 --> 00:38:36.633
beautiful.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.433
I'll take a few more photos of you,

00:38:45.733 --> 00:38:47.900
so you can have some nice photos.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.900
Sure.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.433
Why don't you sit down?

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.866
Sun and I had known each other
for only a short time,

00:39:07.566 --> 00:39:10.800
but we were compatible
and worked together on a few gigs.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.733
We got close quickly, Aoy and Chod.

00:39:31.633 --> 00:39:33.433
I need to use the restroom.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Sure.

00:40:03.133 --> 00:40:04.500
Santa's almost here.

00:40:05.766 --> 00:40:07.800
- Santa?
- Yes.

00:40:08.333 --> 00:40:10.300
- Sister.
- Tandy.

00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:11.400
Yes.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Tandy?

00:40:25.966 --> 00:40:29.433
(Tan)

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.933
(Tan)

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.100
Sandy.

00:40:53.766 --> 00:40:54.766
What's wrong?

00:41:15.033 --> 00:41:16.033
Come in.

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:23.233
Thank you for taking me home.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:24.733
I'm fine now.

00:41:25.133 --> 00:41:27.833
Okay, I'll get going.

00:41:28.366 --> 00:41:29.366
Sun.

00:41:31.233 --> 00:41:32.233
I...

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:34.900
Sun.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.700
Aoy and Chod,

00:41:50.366 --> 00:41:53.233
maybe I shouldn’t take too long
to get to know someone.

00:41:54.033 --> 00:41:55.733
If he were the one,

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.100
I wouldn’t be wasting time.

00:42:16.633 --> 00:42:19.800
Do you like the new toy I sent you?

00:42:20.333 --> 00:42:21.333
I do.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.700
Thank you.

00:42:28.666 --> 00:42:29.666
Sandy.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.833
They say they don’t want to commit,

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:52.133
but in reality,
they just don’t like you.

00:42:55.766 --> 00:42:57.066
I’m here for my reward.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
What are you waiting for?

00:43:00.666 --> 00:43:01.900
I can explain.

00:43:02.266 --> 00:43:03.533
Don’t explain anything.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.100
If you leave my place now,

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.933
just know

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.100
your career in the entertainment
industry is over.

00:43:12.033 --> 00:43:13.366
Marry me.

00:43:14.066 --> 00:43:15.066
We should go our separate ways.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.466
Please don't go, Tan.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.333
My groom is so handsome.

00:43:33.966 --> 00:43:34.966
Who is he?

00:43:35.033 --> 00:43:36.900
Come on.

00:43:37.566 --> 00:43:38.600
Go.

00:43:43.333 --> 00:43:45.466
Turn this way
and go to the second spot.

00:43:46.866 --> 00:43:49.333
No.

00:43:49.933 --> 00:43:50.933
No.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.866
Slap him.
