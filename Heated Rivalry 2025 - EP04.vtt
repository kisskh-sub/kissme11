00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.417
- Yeah, damn right we do.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:23.168
If you want her to
make your gross food

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.921
and keep my house stocked
with ginger ale.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.422
- Stop it!
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:28.340
Ruby, you're gonna kill her.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.342
(Girls shouting in distance)

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.426
(Baby fussing)

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:33.095
- Tell your dad
to leave me alone.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.098
- Um, excuse me?

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.266
Are you Shane Hollander?

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:39.309
- Yeah.

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.602
- Oh my God!

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.354
Can we get a picture with you?

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.775
- Um, I kind of have
my hands full at the moment.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.528
- Um, could you hold
his baby for him, please,

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.113
so we can get a picture?

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.951
- "Hold his baby"?

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:56.160
- I'm sorry, buddy!

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:58.495
- Hey, first of all,
it's my fucking baby.

00:08:58.496 --> 00:08:59.704
- Four times.

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.706
- And second...
Wait, do I have all the kids?

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:02.625
(Girls laughing)

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.627
Oh, you're the worst one!

00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:06.294
- You can't say
stuff like that to her.

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:08.839
- It's true. Second, they didn't
even fucking recognize me.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.840
- Ding, ding, ding!
we've hit five times.

00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:12.551
That's when I'm
supposed to text Jacki.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.219
- I'm telling on you, Daddy!
- Narc!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.470
- Narc, narc!

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:17.139
- I'm getting a vasectomy.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.766
- Way too late.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:22.520
- (Woman on TV): <i>But this is
Shane Hollander's</i>

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.229
<i>fortress of solitude.</i>

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.147
<i>Here in Eastern Quebec</i>

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:28.567
<i>is the house he had built
on a private lake.</i>

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.652
- <i>It's my favorite
place on Earth.</i>

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.487
<i>My parents' cottage,
where I spent summers,</i>

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:33.364
<i>is 10 minutes away.</i>

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:34.699
- I'm ready.

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:38.326
Unless you've decided
we should stay in and watch...

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:40.036
whatever this is.

00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:41.163
- Sorry.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.332
It's so fucking boring
I almost fell into a coma.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:45.834
- Mmm.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.504
He's fucking hot, though.

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:50.881
(Chuckling)

00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:57.972
Are you seeing
anyone these days?

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:00.891
- Are you jealous?

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.644
- No. I think you know me
better than that.

00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:07.522
So there's no one serious?

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:08.858
- Nope.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:12.903
- Not even Jane?

00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:16.365
What?

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:22.079
You've been texting for years.
I thought maybe it was serious.

00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:23.664
Or something.

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.251
- It's not serious.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.211
Or anything.

00:10:31.088 --> 00:10:32.214
- OK.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.841
Sasha says hi.

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.227
- I'm, uh, heading out
for a bit.

00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:47.646
- Cool.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:49.440
- Uh, to meet a friend.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.774
- Nice!

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:53.069
- I'll be back later.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.736
- I won't wait up.

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.739
- It's not like that.

00:10:56.864 --> 00:10:58.573
It's just a--a friend.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.619
- So Lily's just a buddy?

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.287
- What?

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:05.163
- Chill. I know you text a Lily.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:06.581
- I don't.

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:08.250
- OK, go get laid, weirdo.

00:11:10.378 --> 00:11:12.421
Or don't. I don't care.

00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:14.339
I hope you do.
You play better after.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.091
- Go fuck yourself.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.342
- Oh, I plan to.
Probably more than once.

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.468
Love a hotel room.

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:19.845
- Gross.
- Bye!

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:23.265
Oh!

00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.809
Oh yeah!

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:34.110
(Doorbell ringing)

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:35.945
(Knocking on door)

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.625
- Do I take my shoes off?

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.252
- No, you're good.

00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:58.299
- Wow.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.468
Wow!

00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:01.137
This place is great.

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:05.266
Did you get this built,
or do you know who did?

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.143
- Mr. Real Estate.

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.562
- That's not what
I meant. I just...

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:12.022
You think we need to talk?

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.565
- No, after.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:14.984
- OK.

00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.287
(Both moaning)

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.088
- Oh!

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.892
(Birds chirping)

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.864
- I should go.

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.870
- Or you could stay.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.040
- Stay?

00:13:12.374 --> 00:13:13.918
- Here tonight.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.004
I'm not done with you.

00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:20.424
And we have
afternoon game tomorrow,

00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:21.926
so no morning practice.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.261
- I told Hayden.

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:26.137
- Is Hayden your mother?

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.389
- No.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.723
- No, he's not?

00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:30.100
- Fuck off.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.354
- Who cares
what you told Hayden?

00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:42.238
Stay.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:45.866
- OK.

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:48.577
- OK?

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.163
- OK.

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.307
Mmm.

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:11.933
- I'm hungry.

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:13.643
- For what?

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:15.271
- For food, pervert.

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.480
- Hey.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.621
- You like tuna melt?

00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:35.833
- You want to make me
a tuna melt?

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.252
- I was gonna make one for me.
I can make two.

00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:42.798
You head to Florida
after this, right?

00:14:42.923 --> 00:14:44.466
- Yeah, right after the game.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:45.884
Tampa, then Sunrise,

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.844
then we go to Dallas
and St. Louis.

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:49.305
- Ah, all the hot spots.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.639
(Chuckling)

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:53.892
Ginger ale cold enough?

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.686
- Yeah, it's great.

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:57.062
- Good.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.982
Food will be ready soon.

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:02.526
(Announcer talking on TV)

00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:04.153
- Jesus Christ!

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:06.571
- You know this guy, Ryan Price?

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.575
- Yeah, from playing against him
and not wanting to fight him.

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.201
You did a season
with him, right?

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:14.996
- Mmm. He is not
what you would think.

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:16.457
- How so?

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.710
- Like, he's quiet.

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:22.421
Doesn't talk.
Keeps to himself.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.716
Not bad guy.
Doesn't make friends.

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:27.926
- Well, he gets traded
every season.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.594
Tough to make friends that way.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:32.014
- Probably he wants
to get traded again.

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:33.599
Buffalo is terrible.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.726
- Yeah, and their team
sucks too.

00:15:36.727 --> 00:15:38.686
(Chuckling)

00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:40.940
- And people say
you're not funny.

00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:43.067
- They do?

00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.026
- Yeah. They say
you're boring, too.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:45.903
- Who says that?

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.279
- Me.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.199
- What's your, uh,
favorite city to play in?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.201
On the road?
- Mmm...

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:56.871
I like New York,
'cause it's New York.

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.582
They fucking hate me there.

00:15:58.707 --> 00:15:59.917
- They hate you everywhere.

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:02.043
- No, not Florida.

00:16:02.044 --> 00:16:04.046
It's full of Boston people.

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.131
And you?

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:10.594
- Uh, I like Ottawa,
'cause it's my hometown.

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:11.928
Toronto, Winnipeg...

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.888
I'm happy they have
a team again.

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:15.807
(Chuckling)

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.393
What, are those boring answers?

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:18.435
- Yes.

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:21.729
- Well, I like
the hot places too.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.065
- Mmm.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.649
- Hot, like weather hot.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.901
- Ah, OK.

00:16:26.026 --> 00:16:27.403
LA is hot.

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:29.029
Hot women.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.409
- Yeah, sure. I mean,
there are hot women everywhere.

00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:39.331
- There is a girl I like here
very much, Svetlana.

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:42.042
- Oh?

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.420
- She's old friend, from Russia.

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.590
Her father was famous goaltender
of Soviet team.

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.344
She knows everything
about hockey.

00:16:53.554 --> 00:16:54.971
- Cool.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:56.765
- And she likes you very much.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:59.434
- Oh.

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:01.769
That's nice.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.689
(Chuckling)

00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:07.191
So she's, like,
your girlfriend?

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:08.986
- No, no. Nothing like that.

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.154
She's old friend.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.449
Sometimes we fuck, but...

00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:19.162
she's busy these days, you know,
new business selling fancy cars.

00:17:19.163 --> 00:17:20.789
- Sounds perfect for you.

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:25.085
- Yes, it's close
to that, but...

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.172
- But what?

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.673
(Inhaling deeply)

00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:34.053
- But it's nothing more
than that for either of us.

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.682

00:29:34.647 --> 00:29:37.400
I'm... Wow, I'm a big fan.

00:29:38.651 --> 00:29:41.362

Detroit's not gonna
go easy on you tomorrow night.

Uh, I was 8,

00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:10.057
and I played this girl who gets
kidnapped and held for ransom.

00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:11.934
- Wow.
- By Bill Paxton.

00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:13.603
- That is terrible.

00:30:13.728 --> 00:30:15.938

pretty nice to me.

00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:17.774
And it was good practice.

00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:19.316
- Getting kidnapped?

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:22.820
- I've been kidnapped
in no less than four movies,

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.948
including the one
I'm doing right now.

00:30:25.865 --> 00:30:26.783
Fuck! You...

00:30:26.908 --> 00:30:28.784
You didn't hear that.

00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:31.079
They will literally
have me murdered

00:30:31.204 --> 00:30:32.913
if they find out I told you.

00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:34.499
- My lips are sealed.

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:38.878
- OK. Your turn.

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:41.755
- Well, I've never
been kidnapped.

00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:43.591
I mean, there have
been threats, but...

00:30:43.716 --> 00:30:45.260
- No, not what I meant.

00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:49.513
Shane Hollander, 8 years old.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:50.974
Paint me a picture.

00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:58.647

on the ice somewhere.

The scouting and crazy stuff

00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:02.860
didn't start
for another couple years,

00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.946
so I'm probably just having fun.

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.616
- Did it stop being fun?

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:11.035
- No.

00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:13.663
Well, I mean, kind of.

00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:16.833
I love it,
but it got more intense,

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:19.502
so I guess I kinda
got more intense too,

00:31:19.627 --> 00:31:21.295
if that makes sense.

00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:23.214
- Yeah, it does.

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:28.802
And I bet that being
the only Asian kid

00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:31.013
didn't make it less intense.

00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:32.640
- I wasn't the only one.

00:31:32.765 --> 00:31:33.974

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.394
He hated me, though.

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:38.146
- Hmm.

00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:40.022
- I have a Western last name,

00:31:40.023 --> 00:31:42.150
so it's like the other kids

00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:44.152
kind of forgot
to make fun of me.

00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:47.530
- And I bet you were pretty
fucking good too, right?

00:31:48.656 --> 00:31:49.698
- I was all right.

00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:50.825
- Hmm.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.035

00:31:54.662 --> 00:31:56.039
Thank you.

00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:58.916
But he still made it to the
frozen four with Princeton.

00:31:58.917 --> 00:31:59.834

00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:02.502

00:32:02.503 --> 00:32:07.383
Uh, and Peter's in the AHL,
undrafted, but hey.

00:32:07.508 --> 00:32:08.717

00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:10.178

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:16.892

00:32:16.893 --> 00:32:17.852
- Uh, no.

00:32:17.977 --> 00:32:19.687
I was here a few years ago

00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:21.731

00:32:28.154 --> 00:32:29.947
- That movie is so bad.
- It's not great.

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:31.240
- No, it's horrible.

00:32:31.366 --> 00:32:32.408
- You were really good in it.

00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:34.201
- I'm so bad in it.
- No, you're good.

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.577
- Well, I'm barely in it.

00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:38.038
I was here for a week,
and it was the summer.

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:40.791
- Mmm. Kind of different

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:44.212
Your winter doesn't scare me.

00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:55.890
