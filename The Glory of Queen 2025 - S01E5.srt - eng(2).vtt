[The Glory of Queen]

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.500
[Episode 5]

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.300
What a big manor!

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.260
[Young Song Zhiyao]

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.300
Yao, do you like it?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.100
Yes.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.620
It's quite spacious.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.780
From now on, this will be our new home.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.100
Now...

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.740
Aunt Ping,
this perfume pouch smells great.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.000
[Song Ping, Song Zhiyao's youngest aunt]

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.900
My dear, a garden here would be lovely.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.780
This is clove,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.780
this is spikenard,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.220
and this one is…

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.220
I know.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.500
This is benzoin.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.060
Benzoin is a resin

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.300
that resembles a small walnut in shape.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.380
It should not be burned directly,
yet it can release a rich fragrance.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.900
Therefore,
it is used in incense mixtures.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.900
You're very smart, Yao.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.580
Mother!

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.580
- Yao!
- Father!

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.140
Yao!

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.340
Yao!

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.300
Aunt Ping...

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.620
I remember now.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.620
I'm not some abandoned little beggar.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.700
My father is Jiang Mushan,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.620
my mother is Song Lian.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.140
I even have an aunt

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.260
named Song Ping.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.060
But wasn't she kidnapped by bandits?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.340
Why is her perfume pouch here?

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.020
Could it be that she's still alive?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.260
Where is she?

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.300
She said you instructed her

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.020
to go to the branch
to fetch the fragrance boxes.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.700
I don't like this color.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.580
Never mind. Let's go.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.700
Let's take a look up ahead.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.820
Miss, check out these pendants.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.100
Qiluo Fragrance.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.380
It was only made today.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.060
Even if she took it secretly,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.060
she wouldn't have scattered it here.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.260
Tell me. Where is the fragrance manual?

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.140
Didn't I already give you
the fragrance manual?

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.940
You dared use a fake one to fool us.
You've got a death wish.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.820
Zhiyao.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.060
Zhiyao.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.700
It hurts.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.140
I was already holding back.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.900
I never would have guessed

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.700
that this hidden cell
is part of the Pei Manor.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.420
A grand household,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.660
and so full of secrets.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.700
Then, tell me

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.780
how exactly did you end up there?

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.300
How should I know?

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.900
I had just stepped
out of the fragrance shop

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.220
when they threw that sack over me.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.180
Could it be that someone
from the Pei Manor

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.300
wanted to kidnap me?

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.540
She kept trying every possible way
to run away.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.020
She was probably going to trade
the fragrance manual.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.420
But then she got caught.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.300
Clearly, the other party
intended to silence her.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.860
Yet why did she end up in a hidden cell

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.580
under the Pei Manor?

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.700
Could it have something to do
with my aunt?

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.260
Looks like I was right.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.540
I'm nothing but a lowly beggar.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.900
What could they possibly want from me?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.140
Could it be
that they were really after you,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.580
and what happened to me
was just meant as a warning?

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.220
Alright.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.620
I'll handle this matter

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.020
and give you an explanation.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.340
But until then,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.060
do not wander off.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.700
Don't worry. Stay by my side,

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.220
and I'll keep you safe.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.180
Ergou and the others are safe for now.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.700
But my aunt's perfume pouch

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.300
has somehow appeared
in the Pei Manor's hidden cell.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.180
This won't do.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.220
I have to stay and find out
what happened to her.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.580
Who am I?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.060
Have you remembered?

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.820
I've already given you plenty of time.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.400
[Song Ping, Song Zhiyao's youngest aunt]

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.620
Look!

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.580
Look!

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.980
Your body remembers me.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.260
It remembers me.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.580
Say it. Tell me.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.860
Who am I? Tell me.

00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:45.755
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:42.580
Tell me.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.220
Master, Song Zhiyao has been rescued.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.980
Why is everyone pushing me?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.940
Including you!

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.740
It's me.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.100
Why are you here?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.220
Why are you here as well?

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.340
I...

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.660
None of your business.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.660
I...

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.380
I figured
you'd come to the hidden cell tonight,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.340
so I came to back you up.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.500
Think about it.
Among all those who despise you

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.060
and are so eager to eliminate
the people around you,

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.780
who else could it be

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.060
but that aunt of yours?

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.060
Using Pei Jingheng

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.500
would allow me to uncover the truth
about my aunt more quickly.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.660
Are you really willing

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.380
to live under her shadow forever?

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.460
I'm telling you,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.740
knowing too much

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.700
won't do you any good.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.780
But I have to get to the bottom of this.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.140
If I don't,

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.140
I'll be taken by them again.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.060
And next time, I'll die.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.260
We're in this together now.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.220
So put all that past nonsense aside

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.500
and work with me properly.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.700
Don't worry.
I work for you,

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.340
and I will never betray you.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.980
What was the relationship

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.420
between those bandits
and the Pei family back then?

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.740
Why did they want to wipe out
my entire family?

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.580
We had only moved to Wu County
for a year at the time.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.100
Aunt,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.780
you're still alive, aren't you?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.580
Zhiyao?

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.140
I was wondering who it was.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.500
Why are you here alone?

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.420
Eldest Young Master.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.460
Looks like something's bothering you.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.220
Did Jingheng give you a hard time?

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.540
No, not at all.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.820
Second Young Master is very kind to me.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.060
As for Jingheng's temper,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.580
I, as his older brother,
of course know it well.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.740
But the fact that he accepted you
as his apprentice

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.740
shows he values you.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.140
You are right.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.580
If you're feeling down,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.660
I can take you out for a stroll.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.620
The Fragrance Festival is coming,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.980
so the county will be lively.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.780
I may not have much say

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.300
in the manor,

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.620
but if you want to go outside,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.740
I can help you.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.940
Think of it as a chance to unwind.
Sound good?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.340
Following Pei Jingheng
can be quite inconvenient.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.740
It might be better to go out
with Eldest Young Master instead,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.540
so I can meet Ergou and the others,

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620
and look into what happened to my aunt.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.620
In that case, I'll thank you in advance,
Eldest Young Master.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.580
Go back now and rest.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.380
I'll send someone
to inform you tomorrow.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.060
Young Master.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.260
Once we're out tomorrow,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.780
search her room
for the fragrance manual.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.220
