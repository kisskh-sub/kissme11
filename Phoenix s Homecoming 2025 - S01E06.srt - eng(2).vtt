=Episode 6=

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.120
On this private visit
to Chaohuang Academy, His Majesty

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.879
took only the Imperial Guards,
a few attendants,

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.280
and Huo Wan.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.120
All affairs were entrusted
to Chancellor Huo.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.200
This clearly shows
the Huo family's prominence at court.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.079
No family remains powerful
in the court forever.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:19.616
One rises, another falls.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920
It's just the Emperor's art
of maintaining balance.

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:24.799
The last disciple
has surpassed his teacher,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.400
seeing through affairs
with piercing clarity.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.879
But as for this Empress,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.079
is she truly the Huo family's treasure?

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.120
Or is she just a pawn in their game?

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.200
She follows His Majesty's
every step dutifully,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.439
exhibiting virtue.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.799
Yet deep down,

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.719
how much genuine feeling exists?

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:49.114
(Huo Wan, The Empress)

00:01:49.114 --> 00:01:52.672
(Chen Yu, The Emperor)

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.439
Your Majesty,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.280
this is the courtyard
where the late Grand Princess resided.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.280
Thanks to careful upkeep,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.239
everything here
remains as it was in her time.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.200
Grand Tutor Xie's been thoughtful.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.439
Though the place remains,
she is gone now.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.719
It only deepens the sorrow.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.840
If I hadn't confined her
in Weiyang Palace back then,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.479
how could she...

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.360
Wan.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:26.719
Your Majesty.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.840
Tell me, did that fire back then

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.800
carry away some secrets with it?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.319
I dare not speculate.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:52.199
With no one else,

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.960
cease your performance.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.639
I'm weary.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080
I wish no disturbance.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.719
You will keep kneeling in the yard

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.719
to appease my sister's spirit.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.159
Your Majesty!

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.319
I don't know
what wrong I have committed.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.080
Ever since the Grand Princess' passing,

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.520
you have humiliated me like this.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.080
Humiliated?

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:22.560
If you weren't a Huo,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.520
you wouldn't be worthy
to appease her soul.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.520
How could you compare to her?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.479
Your Maj...

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:37.088
(Chaohuang Academy)

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.080
In the case of Su Wei's corruption,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.000
I borrowed the Grand Princess' name.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.360
This was disrespectful to the royalty.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.039
I came specifically
to beg for punishment.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.360
How rare.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.479
You still hold reverence
for the Grand Princess.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.759
Your plan

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.159
exposed the corrupt official's crimes

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.879
and cleared my sister's name.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.400
What a brilliant scheme indeed.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.439
I dare not accept such praise
from Your Majesty.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.560
It was all due
to your skillful arrangements

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.079
and masterful strategy.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.959
With you successfully out of the palace,

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.439
acting naturally becomes much easier.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.959
I see far fewer spies around you now.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.639
Now that I'm out,

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.759
it's time I truly see

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:44.160
the Chen State my sister left me.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.759
Your foresight

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.279
is beyond what I can achieve.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.319
If I truly had such foresight,

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.360
how could I fail to keep my sister?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.319
(Young Chen Yu)
Sister, are you hiding well?

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.160
If you are, I'm coming to find you!

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:10.680
Sister!

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.120
Sister!

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:20.720
Oh, no!

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.279
It's the rebels!

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.040
(Back then, Ninth Lord rebelled.)

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:26.839
(Without my sister taking me,)

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.920
(I would have died in the garden.)

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.680
It's okay. Follow me.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:33.480
Hiding in the woodshed,

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.720
it was because my sister
kept encouraging me

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.800
that I endured for nine days.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:40.040
Be good.

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.759
Hold on a little longer.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.800
Listen!

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.000
The sounds of fighting have stopped.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.759
Maybe the rebellion

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.920
has been quelled out there.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.680
In a few days...

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.720
In a few days, we can go out.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.079
But, Sister,

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.759
where should we go?

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.160
Where?

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:06.319
To...

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.399
To hide our tracks,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.000
she took me into Yeyou Court,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.399
where disgraced officials' children
were force into labor.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:18.439
Don't you sleep!

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.439
It hurts!

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.079
Madam.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.319
You were born a son of Yeyou Court.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.199
And now you're acting all precious!

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.560
I'll beat you to death!

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.319
Trash! You shameless fool!

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:31.519
Sister,

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.519
what is the point of living?

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:35.600
I'll kill you!

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.759
People live

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.720
for a reason.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.399
I will tell you later.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.600
(History as a Mirror)
Yu,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.720
we can't go on drifting

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.240
aimlessly in Yeyou Court like this.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.720
Starting today,

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:08.199
I will teach you to read every day.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:09.759
Look.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.000
History as a Mirror.

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:14.560
Reading enlightens the mind.

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.120
(Thrown into hardship,)

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:30.079
(Sister still urged me
not to lose heart)

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.240
(and learn the art of emperors.)

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.000
(It was her who taught me
how to be an emperor.)

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.920
(But when I became emperor,
I killed her.)

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.720
(If I hadn't been selfish)

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.279
(back then,)

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.720
(would she not have died?)

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.360
Sister,

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:50.279
let's go see a play.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.000
That piece you placed earlier

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.319
is about to act.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.040
Please.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.639
Please.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.079
Manager.

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:14.639
What a rare guest!

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:15.839
What a rare guest!

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:17.120
Lord Jia,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.959
you've left Zhuozhou in three years.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.040
Yes, yes.

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:21.000
What

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:23.160
brings you here this time?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.360
Keep it low. Low profile.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:28.600
I heard that there will be several
great scholars from Qi tomorrow.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.680
That's truly rare to see!

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.840
Although Chen and Qi
are not on good terms,

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.440
literature is innocent!

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.200
Yes.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.600
If we miss this opportunity,

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:42.240
it will be the regret of a lifetime.

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:43.480
Look.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.720
Your attire today

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.440
is quite ingenious.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.600
Of course.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.000
This time, we invited
great scholars from Qi here.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.519
I can't afford to be impolite, right?

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:56.679
Yes.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.679
The prey is hooked.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.320
You deserve the chief credit.

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:03.360
Then tell me.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.480
Compared to Xie the ice block,

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:07.399
am I more formidable?

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.519
If you are asking about fashion sense,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.279
it will be you, of course.

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:13.639
That's not what I'm talking about.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.240
Who would ask you

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.120
such an obvious thing?

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:19.519
Back to business.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.840
Jia Cheng, the Ghost Fire,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.120
is little known in daily life
and rarely comes to the capital.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.799
However, he has some special hobbies.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.039
He likes to take in
down-and-out guests as retainers.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.600
His reputation is quite good.

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:38.039
Back then, shortly after Jia Cheng
was imprisoned,

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.399
he disappeared.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.679
Now, there comes

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.759
the Ghost Fire.

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.279
And,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.279
the Ghost Fire retainer Cheng Qianzhi
specially invited by you.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.080
Meeting an old acquaintance again,
are you pleased?

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:59.200
(Back then, Lu Chengfeng)

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:02.639
(led the border army to attack Qi.)

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.879
(The Sheng army assisted
with elite troops.)

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.960
(Chancellor Huo claimed)

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.399
(To the Emperor of Qi)
(that the Sheng army defected,)

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:15.320
(leading to the border army's
total defeat.)

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.679
(Lu Chengfeng even
committed suicide in court to atone.)

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.879
But do you believe such a person

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.120
would willingly kill himself?

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:30.639
Please.

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:31.440
Please, please.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.759
- Please.
- Come on. Let's go.

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.600
Cheng, how is the meal?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:47.759
Good.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.039
Really good.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.559
Cheng, fill it up.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.480
Cheng, please.

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:04.559
Jia, please.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:12.639
Cheng,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.840
today, let's drink and chat merrily.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.879
I will tell you a palace secret.

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:21.879
The Empress is finally pregnant?

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.840
That'd be all over the streets

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.879
if such joyous news were true.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.000
I am talking about His Majesty,
the current emperor.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.440
I heard that
after the Grand Princess' death,

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.039
he has been wandering in a daze
all day long.

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:47.720
He doesn't even visit
the imperial harem.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.799
The relationship between His Majesty
and the Grand Princess is a bit...

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.120
His Majesty and the Grand Princess

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.799
aren't even blood-related.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.399
Jia, you really have eyes

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:07.000
and ears everywhere.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.320
You flatter me.

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:10.279
Come on. Drink up!

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:12.799
- Come on...
- (This Drunken Stupor works wonders.)

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:15.279
(It's making people
babble nonsense so fast.)

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:30.159
I've long heard of you, Lord Jia.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.559
(The Reign of Yao and Shun)
I toast you.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240
This calligraphy piece...

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:37.159
What should we do now?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:38.679
Calligraphy piece?

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:46.039
What a pity!

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:53.120
Just let it be.

00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:57.840
Jia is a master forger.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.679
It's not difficult at all.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.600
Just create another masterpiece
for the beauty.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.279
I've long heard

00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:07.960
that someone can easily imitate
countless handwriting styles.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.120
No one can tell.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.399
Now, this masterpiece is ruined.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.799
I've become the culprit.

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.519
I only hope to meet someone

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:16.519
who can absolve my guilt.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.600
I'll spare no effort

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.240
and never betray my word.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.159
It's not difficult at all.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.720
Bring me the brush.

00:13:41.025 --> 00:13:45.519
(The Reign of Yao and Shun)

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:46.200
Cheng,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.240
what do you think?

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:50.519
It's indistinguishable.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.159
Truly remarkable.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:54.559
Isn't this
the Grand Princess' handwriting?

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:55.360
Indeed.

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:58.000
Why is it written identically?

00:13:58.159 --> 00:13:58.919
Exactly!

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:00.279
It seems really authentic.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.879
Go! Go!

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Get out!

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.879
Get out!

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:12.080
All of you!

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.240
You...

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:26.919
Why are you wearing these clothes?

00:14:27.039 --> 00:14:28.039
Take them off now.

00:14:28.159 --> 00:14:30.679
This is a capital offense!

00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:32.840
The Grand Princess is dead.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:35.440
I, the false witness,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.679
should be silenced too.

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:39.559
Cook the dog once it catches the hare.

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.200
Are you going to...

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:43.639
Those who know secrets in this world

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:45.279
never keep silent forever.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480
Only the dead....

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:48.120
Only the dead can keep secrets.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.200
You... shut your mouth!

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.799
Don't mention this again.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.120
If you want to die, don't drag me down!

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.200
I want to live, so you must die.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.759
- What is this?
- You must die.

00:14:57.559 --> 00:14:58.679
I want to live.
