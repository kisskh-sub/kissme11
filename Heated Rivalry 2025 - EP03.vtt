- Where's your boy Rozanov?
- My what?

00:00:03.962 --> 00:00:05.588
Scott Hunter is right next door.

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:07.465
No, I mean, not in a...
Not your boy.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.677
Just, like, it's always
Hollander and Rozanov, right?

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:14.222
He is hot. We should let him
listen like mating call.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.266
- He's an asshole, right?
- Yeah, basically.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.018
<i>The record for this event,</i>

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.645
<i>currently held by the New York
Admirals' Scott Hunter...</i>

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.231
Glad Rozanov didn't hold my
record for more than a minute.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.066
Nice shooting, rook.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.444
- Thought it was Hunter's year.
- Babe!

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.529
- Can you believe Russia?
- Be nice, Vaughnny.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.114
Hey, what did Roz
say about it?

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:33.950
I don't know.
Nothing to me, that's for sure.

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.494
We're not, like, friends
or anything.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.371
I'm sure someone else
grabbed him.

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.457
It's USA this year, baby!
We're coming for you. Trust me.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.083
You look great
in silver, Vaughnny.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.626
- Oh, good one.
- Oh!

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.224
<i>Ha. I want some
ice cream bad, man.</i>

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:59.893
<i>Do you not find it weird</i>

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:02.437
<i>that we're in a beach town
in Russia in February,</i>

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.064
<i>talking about getting ice cream?</i>

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.398
<i>Winter Olympics, baby.</i>

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.150
Just as it should be, right?

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.694
Hey, isn't--isn't that...

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.154
Oh, yeah.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.823
Hollander!
What's up, motherfucker?

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.367
- Boys...
- Hey.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.536
So, we'll do men's
short-form figure skating?

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:21.247
My buddy Joe is in that
program. We trained together.

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:23.166
Would you guys be cool
to do that?

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.292
I'd love to show up for him.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.668
Hell yeah, man.

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.045
Show up for any dude
who's that brave.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.671
What do you mean?

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:32.175
Well, I'm assuming
your buddy might be gay.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.511
I mean...

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:37.055
Fucking brave for a dude
to show up to this place

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.807
and be like: "Hey, here's me."

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.227
Russia is not safe
for folks like that.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.854
Fucking balls of steel, man.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.356
Yeah.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.201

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:06.876
<i>70 points last season.</i>

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.712
<i>Yes, and we're 6 games
into this season.</i>

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.882
<i>A season he called
"need to win."</i>

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.886
<i>Those are his words.
And he has zero, zero points.</i>

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:18.596
<i>He's in a fog.</i>

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.515
<i>His passes aren't connecting.
He's barely skating.</i>

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.725
<i>I can't imagine he's amazing

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.561

<i>as Team USA captain

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:03.141
Um...

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.273
I am very sorry about that.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.774
It's really not a big deal.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.276
How may I help you?

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:16.196
Uh, what's, uh, what's good?

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.323
Um...

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.325
Just a bunch of
very decent smoothies

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.951
with deeply stupid names.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:24.954
Any allergies?
- No, no, no, I'm easy.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.625
OK. I mean, the best one's
the blueberry one, but...

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.127
Oh, you mean
Blue Moon Over Brooklyn?

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:32.295
Yeah, that's it.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.296
But what?

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.964
Oh, nothing.

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.426
Just when I make it for myself
in the morning, I add a banana.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.221
Oh, so you're kind of wild.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.348
I mean, it wouldn't be
the first time

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.475
somebody's told me that.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.936
Uh, yeah, that actually
sounds pretty good.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:48.978
Yeah?

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.480
Blueberry with a banana.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:54.525
I'd take that, if it's OK
to order off menu, Kip.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:56.653
Uh, I mean, technically,
it was my idea,

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.030
so I think we can
get away with it this time.

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.181
Oh, you weren't kidding.
It's really good.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.516
Oh, yeah.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.977
The banana makes
a big difference, I think.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.395
Yeah...

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:33.356
I guess it must.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.403
Here.
- Thanks.

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.448
Um, that's way too much.

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:45.326
It's for you.
It's a great smoothie.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:47.453
Thanks again, Kip.

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.795
Holy shit! Are you--

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.383
Was that Scott Hunter?

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.759
Was that what?

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:03.803
Scott Hunter,
the hockey player.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.265
Girl!

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.851

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:14.689
And... this is what
we're watching?

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.734
We barely get to see you
'cause you're always working,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.902
but at least when we do,
we get to watch, uh...

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:22.280
What is this?
Let me check my book. Hockey?

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:23.281
Shut up, Shawn.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.407
Oh, so turn it off?

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.242
No, no, no, please keep it on.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:27.869
- All right.
- Thank you, Kyle.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.163
- Thank you, Kyle.
- Thank you, Kyle.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:31.581
You're quite welcome.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:33.791
Twice, he said "Kip."

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:36.044
Like, he used
your actual name twice.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.838
Maria, that is
setting the bar so low.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.049
It didn't even
sound stupid when he said it.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.467
It almost sounded hot.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:44.135
OK, that's not fair.
Not hot, just normal.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.720
OK, I'm listening.

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.097
Fuck both of you, OK?
Kip is short for Christopher.

00:05:48.222 --> 00:05:49.223
It's not that weird.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.475
It's shortbus
for Christopher.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.185
Please don't tell me
you used it

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.728
on your grad school application.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.772
Oh my God, why are we
talking about my dumb name?

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:57.315
- He said it!
- He said it.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.901
Another round?

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:03.112
- Thank you, Kyle.
- Thank you, Kyle.

Thank you, Kyle.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.453
Oh, look, look, look!

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.454

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:12.455

<i>Vaughn to Hunter.</i>

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:15.458
<i>Hunter is in front of the net.</i>

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:16.626
<i>And he scores!</i>

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:17.960
<i>A rare goal for Scott Hunter.</i>

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.129
Right?

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:21.631
He knows your name.

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.050
Yeah. I mean,
he's definitely not gay, but...

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.927
Shut the fuck up!
He literally blushed!

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.096
Then make him gay.
Jesus Christ!

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.475
He scored
a hat trick last night.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.102
Are you asking me
what that means,

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:36.521
or are you just telling me
something I already know?

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.106
I just didn't realize that...

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.733
We literally
watched the game, Kip.

00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:46.823
Nice to see you again, Kip.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:49.158
Nice to see you again, uh...

00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:50.993
Scott.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.287
You're Scott Hunter, right?
- I am.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.664
This is awesome.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.999
I mean, wow, you
had a night last night.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.167
Oh, did you watch?

00:06:58.292 --> 00:06:59.836
I did, yeah. I don't usually.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.921
Sorry, that sounds rude. I'm...

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:03.339
No, I get it.

00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:05.675
Well, I watched the playoffs
last year with my dad.

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.010
It was amazing.
He's a huge fan.

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.597
But, yeah, I watched
last night. Wow.

00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:15.143
Um, yeah, when something
goes right with my game,

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.354
I try to repeat it,
and then I try to perfect it.

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.022
OK.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:23.025
So, I'd love
another smoothie, please.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:26.696
Anything you'd like different?

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:28.614
Nothing at all.

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.616
There you go.

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:33.327
OK, you really
can't keep doing this.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.704
I really can.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.081
Uh, see you next game day,
I hope.

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:43.212
Dude.

00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:44.338
- Girl.
- Was that...

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.840
Yes, it fucking was.

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:54.849
Sorry I'm late!

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:56.392
No outside food or drink.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.019
Fuck off, Kyle.

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:03.649
And I know the whole smoothie
thing is dumb or whatever,

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:04.984
but he just keeps
saying my name,

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:06.777
and it's low key
making me crazy.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:09.280
You're still coming to
that fundraiser, though, right?

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.907
I am not looking for a date.

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:13.743
Yes, I told you I could come,
and it's in, like, two months.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.411
Could you please listen to me?

00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:16.746
Kyle, remote!

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:22.543
Extra shrimp.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:24.086
Thank you.

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:27.757
<i>New York with control...</i>

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.300
OK. Now I'm fully listening.

00:08:29.425 --> 00:08:30.384
What are you doing?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.469
Just putting the game on.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.637
- Elena!
- What?

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:33.721
It's a sports bar.

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:35.181
Let's watch sport.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:36.599
Am I being crazy?

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.434
What does Maria say?

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.936
She says he's
flirting with me too.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.395
She is much
smarter than you.

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.605
And probably this idiot.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.190
<i>The Admirals...</i>

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:45.483
He's not an idiot.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.817
<i>Scott Hunter is...</i>

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:48.861
Jesus!

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:50.321
Right?

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.656
When's his next home game?

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.115
- I don't know.
- Come on.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.951
If you don't know when
his next game is,

00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:56.452
how are you gonna
plan your shift?

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:57.828
I don't plan my shifts.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.997
I just gobble up
as many as I can.

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:02.959
Saturday. They play
at home again on Saturday.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.628
Are you working?
- Um...

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:08.589
Fuck. No.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:10.091
Fix that.

00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:19.141
Kip!

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:20.935
Hey.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.812
I didn't know if you, uh...

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.775
Well, it's...
it's nice to see you.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.153
Uh, Blue Moon
Over Brooklyn, please.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.155
Extra banana.

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.538
This one's on the house.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:41.664
Oh, come on.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:42.832
It's above my pay grade.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.000
Management heard you came in.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.502
And, no, you may not tip me.

00:09:46.627 --> 00:09:48.504
And, yes, I'm using
proper grammar

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:50.673
to prove to you
that I'm being serious.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.593
OK. Um...

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:56.012
Uh, may I drink this here?

00:09:56.178 --> 00:09:58.598
I've got some emails
to answer, so I thought...

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.850
Yeah, you totally may.

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:36.052
You're not worried about
breaking your routine?

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.764
No, I'm not actually
that obsessive.

00:10:40.848 --> 00:10:43.267
Turns out I'm too lazy
to be a serial killer.

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:44.727
I took a quiz.

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:47.480
I don't even think
I could be a spree killer.

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:49.106
What's a spree killer?

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:52.193
Someone who kills multiple
people at the same time.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:53.611
But isn't...

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:56.238
A serial killer is someone
who kills multiple people,

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.406
minimum of three,

00:10:57.531 --> 00:10:59.325
but over a period of time,
not all at once.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.785
Mmm.

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.245
How do you know that?

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:06.415
I read a lot of murder books.

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:08.417
And, uh...

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:12.922
Yeah, serial killers
make me feel not obsessive,

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:15.424
which... which is a relief.

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:19.053
Well, I've read some things
about athletes.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:22.264
OK, OK, before you say
anything else, yes, I agree.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.850
And yes, there are at least
two guys on my team

00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:27.603
that possibly off the record,
yes, maybe.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.021
But no, not me.

00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:32.316
No, I swear.
Barely had two concussions.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.112
OK, so, what,
no left sock, right sock,

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:38.030
stop shaving, no sex,
all that stuff?

00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:39.949
Oh, no, yeah, yeah, yeah,
all of that.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.410
But that's not CTE stuff,
that's just science.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.704
And science only really matters
during playoffs.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.831
Oh, OK,
that's super comforting.

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.624
I know you're
more of an art guy,

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:52.211
so it's not like I expect you to
get the ins and outs of science.

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.130
And just to be clear,
I'm not complaining

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:55.923
about the whole
stop shaving thing.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:58.384
You all look like hot
lumberjacks by the end of May.

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.188
Uh...

00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:15.025
Do you want to come
to my game tonight?

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:17.862
I have two seats.
No one's taking them.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.614
So, I mean, if...
if you want.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.324
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:23.576
Yeah, I want.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:26.454
Um... Fuck, man, that's crazy.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:27.580
Thank you.

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.248
Super happy to do it.

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:31.417
You sure?

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:34.754
I'm sure.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.176
These are better
than my company seats.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.051
I get it.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.553
These are really good seats.

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:43.971
Well, yeah, they're his.

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:48.601
You know, weird first date,
but I think I'm into this.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.144
What are you talking about?

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.188
Well, you're with a girl,
and he's at work, so...

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.981
Oh my God!
Shut up, Elena.

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:56.984
Oh, wow!

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:59.361
That wasn't...
That wasn't to me. That was...

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.529
He just nodded at you.

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:02.531
No, there's no proof of that.

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.456
Wave back, for fuck's sake.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.540
OK.

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:21.884
Good job, I love you.

00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:23.511
I love you. I love you.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:24.637
I love you.

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:26.597
Good job. I love you.

00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:28.265
Hey, Hunter!

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.143
Too bad you can't play
at home every night, right?

00:13:31.268 --> 00:13:32.895
It's better for you, huh?

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.564
Go fuck yourself, Rozanov!

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.149
It's more fun
if you're there.

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:42.238
Hey, thanks!

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.328
Hope next time we play,
you decide to show up.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:52.414
Cheap.

00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:53.499
True.

00:13:56.585 --> 00:13:58.754
You're starting
to sound like him.

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.840
I'm sorry, what?

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.760
You fucking heard me,
Hollander.

00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:06.595
What the fuck
does that mean?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.056
<i>Well, there's something you
really don't expect to see.</i>

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:10.683
<i>Especially after
the final whistle.</i>

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.185
<i>And especially
from Hollander and Hunter.</i>

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.812
<i>A fittingly brutal end</i>

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.605
<i>to another brutal road trip
for the Admirals.</i>

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.149
<i>Has Shane Hollander
ever fought anybody?</i>

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.777
<i>Seem to have
some grievances to air out--</i>

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:23.821
- I'm gonna hit the sack.
- Yeah.

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:24.947
Here you go, handsome.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.740
All right, have a good day off.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.785
It's not a day off. I'm doing
that catering thing tomorrow.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.496
Yeah, yeah, just, you know,
you get to sleep in for once.

00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:33.956
So I'm just happy for you.

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:35.332
That's all I meant.

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:36.458
You know.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.503
I, uh, I'm proud
of your hustle, kiddo.

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.005
You know?

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.132
And you're gonna
get that scholarship!

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:44.967
Please, please, no jinxing me.

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.802
No way, no way. Good night.

00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:48.429
Good night, Dad. Love you.

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:49.680
Love you back!

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:55.644
Motherfucker!

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:03.360
What's happening to you?
What's your problem?

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:06.655
I can't find my black suit,
and I have to leave so, so soon.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.658
OK, well, it's with
the dry cleaning in my closet,

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:11.035
so why are you freaking out?

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.245
OK, hey, hey, are you OK?

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.080
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:17.458
I need the money,
and I can't fuck this job up.

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.751
Yes, and I get it,

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.629
but you're not gonna fuck it up
'cause you're amazing,

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:22.713
and it's gonna be great.

00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:23.881
I love you!

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:25.007
Yeah, you too.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.508
Yes, buddy!

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.513
I am so sorry.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.098
Save it.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.897
Motherfucker!

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.357
For God's sake!

00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:43.609
I'm so sorry about that.
I'm really sorry.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:44.985
Oh, you're a mess.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.404
It's OK. It's not my only tux.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.532
New York used to have
professional waiters.

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:52.326
Now it's models
who can't carry a tray.

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.703
It's, uh, it's really OK.

00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:56.038
I'm so sorry again.

00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:57.998
Oh, bunny.

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.709
Babe, I don't know
what that was...

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:03.796
I know, I'm a complete
fuck-up, and I'm sorry.

00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:05.464
You're not a complete fuck-up.

00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:08.217
This is not rocket science
or whatever it is you're into.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:10.219
Art. Shawn,
please don't fire me.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:12.304
No one is firing you.

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:15.391
Just calm down
and get your shit together. OK?

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.475
OK.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.810
I know you need
the money, baby.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.520
- Yeah.
- OK?

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:20.938
Deep breath.

00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:22.940
Inhale.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.233
Exhale.

00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:28.988
You think you can handle quiche?
They're dry.

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:32.783
And two.

00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:45.212
Hey.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:47.423
Hey, I am so sorry
about earlier.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:49.091
That woman is horrible,

00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:51.218
and I'm the one
who should apologize.

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:53.012
I was in front of
the door like an idiot.

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.346
No, I'm the idiot.

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:55.931
You're just a normal,
hungry person

00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.182
at a fundraiser.

00:16:57.307 --> 00:16:58.517
And that woman
did seem horrible.

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:00.352
Full disclosure:
I hate this food.

00:17:00.477 --> 00:17:03.105
Well, full disclosure,
I hate serving it.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:05.858
I'm sorry, I have to...

00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:07.484
Do you like Mexican food?

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:11.238
Yeah, of course,
I'm not a serial killer.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.948
Or even a spree killer.

00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.033
You sure?

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:16.702
Yeah, who has the time?

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.912
Do you have the time
to grab a bite with me

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.456
when this thing is over?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.499
Tonight?

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:23.751
Yeah.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.294
With you?

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:27.129
Uh, well, yeah.

00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:30.090
Uh, OK. Yeah, yeah.

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.800
'Cause there's, uh,
this great place

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:34.303
right around the corner,
and it's open late and...

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:36.597
OK. You don't mind
waiting until I'm done?

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.265
Not even a little.

00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:01.330
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:10.506
Oh! That's a long line.

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.049
Is it worth it?

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:13.926
Um...

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:16.220
Probably not, right?

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:19.681
We also don't actually
have to do this.

00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:22.518
How would you feel
about ordering in?

00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:38.867
Holy shit!

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.791
Oh my God.

00:18:58.262 --> 00:18:59.805
Wow.

00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:06.812
I mean, I--I figured
you'd have a nice place,

00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:10.399
but this is insane.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:15.112
Do you want
the full tour now, or...

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:16.113
Or.

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:18.240
I pick or.

00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:53.817
Wow. Wow,
you are so beautiful.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.994
I can't believe
you're even into me.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.704
I'm so into you.

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:07.456
So into you.

00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:09.625
I can't stop thinking about you.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.018
Yeah.

00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:30.270
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:35.692
Oh my God!

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:51.875
What are you doing?

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:54.628
I didn't want to wake you.

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:57.422
And I just thought since
you have your game tomorrow,

00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:59.549
and, you know...

00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:09.559
Can you stay?

00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:12.271
Yeah.

00:21:13.397 --> 00:21:15.482
Then stay, please.

00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:18.026
OK.

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:51.977
Did I wake you?

00:21:52.102 --> 00:21:53.562
Ah...

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:55.230
OK, I meant to surprise you,

00:21:55.355 --> 00:21:56.982
and I was gonna
go out and get stuff,

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:58.358
but I looked in your fridge,

00:21:58.483 --> 00:21:59.901
and you basically
had all the ingredients.

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:01.737
I know I shouldn't be
snooping around,

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:03.572
but I didn't have to do
that much snooping.

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:05.032
You are very organized.

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.409
And I thought,
since I'm not working today,

00:22:07.576 --> 00:22:08.744
but you still have your game,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.537
that you probably
still want your...

00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:22.632
Can I fuck you?

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.385
Absolutely.

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:39.066
So...

00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:43.028
I should probably go.

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:45.822
Hmm.

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:51.453
Um, what if you didn't?

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.164
- Go?
- Yeah.

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:55.540
Like, ever?

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:58.960
Fuck!

00:22:59.086 --> 00:23:01.588
All that serial killer talk
was you warning me, wasn't it?

00:23:06.259 --> 00:23:07.302
Um...

00:23:08.428 --> 00:23:09.846
I'm, uh...

00:23:10.972 --> 00:23:13.892
I'm gonna say
a bunch of things, OK?

00:23:14.017 --> 00:23:17.396
And I know I'm too intense,
everyone tells me that,

00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:19.398
but I just...
I can't help it.

00:23:19.523 --> 00:23:21.691
Is that OK?
Can I be too intense?

00:23:23.151 --> 00:23:25.153
Yeah. Yeah.

00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:28.115
Yeah. I, um...

00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:31.993
I never do this.

00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:36.456
Never brought anyone back here.
Like, ever.

00:23:37.416 --> 00:23:39.292
Um, yeah.

00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:41.795
My life is, uh,
is complicated.

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.673
Yeah, I--I get that.

00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:50.887
And I can't, um...

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.017
come out, like...

00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:58.228
Not--not right now.

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:01.314
Too many people depend on me
for too much,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.025
and it would just...
it would fuck everything up.

00:24:05.193 --> 00:24:07.696
And so I just thought
I would, um,

00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:11.199
I don't know, wait, I guess.

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:15.871
Yeah, wait till hockey was over,

00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:19.749
and then maybe
I could fade away a bit or...

00:24:22.544 --> 00:24:24.171
But I, um...

00:24:26.923 --> 00:24:29.885
You, it's just, um...

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.181
I want you so bad.

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.892
So bad.

00:24:37.893 --> 00:24:39.644
And I know that
you barely know me,

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:41.438
so why would you
even consider something

00:24:41.563 --> 00:24:42.772
this probably fucked up?

00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:45.233
Like, I--I know
I'm fucked up. I get it.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.194
I'm not pretending I'm not.

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:50.030
But I really, really like you.

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:54.493
And I want you to stay.

00:24:55.744 --> 00:24:58.079
So I'm asking for what I want.

00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:04.169
I want you to be here when
I get back from practice later.

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:06.963
And I, uh, want you to be here

00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:09.257
when I come home
from my game tonight.

00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:12.177
I, um...

00:25:13.386 --> 00:25:16.598
I want you more than I've wanted
anything in a long time.

00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:22.229
Is, uh, is that too much?

00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:27.609
You can say it if it is. Um...

00:25:29.319 --> 00:25:31.279
Do say something, though.

00:25:55.428 --> 00:25:58.223
I think I'd love to be here
when you get back.

00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:04.980
And I don't think you're
too lazy to be a serial killer.

00:26:06.356 --> 00:26:07.274
Really?

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:08.525
Yeah, really.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.318
Yeah, you're definitely
not lazy.

00:26:16.992 --> 00:26:17.993
Hey.

00:26:18.118 --> 00:26:18.827
Hey.

00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:20.245
How was practice?

00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:29.504
I don't know,
like, a few days ago?

00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:32.090
Yes, I sent in the applications.

00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:35.468
Yes, and even to BU.
And, yes, I know we hate Boston.

00:26:37.012 --> 00:26:39.180
With Elena, Dad.
I'm staying with Elena.

00:26:39.347 --> 00:26:40.849
So I don't have to
schlep to work.

00:26:40.974 --> 00:26:42.684
I get to sleep in an extra hour.

00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.645
Fuck yes!

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.981
Nothing, Dad.
No, I'm just watching the game.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.359
Yes, with Elena, oh my God, Dad.

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:02.037
Where has she even been?

00:27:02.203 --> 00:27:04.331
Oh, please!
I saw you three days ago.

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:05.707
Single since forever.

00:27:05.874 --> 00:27:08.209
Overworked like she has
two wicked stepsisters.

00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:11.212
Then she gets a man
and vanishes. What a cliché.

00:27:11.379 --> 00:27:12.422
I don't have a man.

00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:14.049
Hey, kid.

00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:16.217
Keep the boyfriend on TV
at all times, please, Kyle.

00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:17.927
Oh my God, guys!
He's a customer.

00:27:18.053 --> 00:27:19.220
He's not my boyfriend.
- Boo!

00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:21.139
I don't have
a fucking boyfriend.

00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:32.567
Oh.

00:27:32.692 --> 00:27:34.736
Hi there.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.243
Morning, Scott.

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:44.579
Morning, Kip.
The usual, please.

00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:46.039
Yeah.

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:49.334
Extra banana.

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:54.214
Not sure what I'll do
without these on my trip.

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:56.424
I'm sure they have smoothies
in other cities.

00:27:56.591 --> 00:27:58.301
Not like these, they don't.

00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:03.473
Do you really think
this is a secret?

00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:04.766
What's a secret?

00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:06.851
Nothing's happening.

00:28:06.976 --> 00:28:08.937
He's just flirting with me
or whatever.

00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:10.689
He's straight, I think.

00:28:10.814 --> 00:28:12.107
Girl...

00:28:19.823 --> 00:28:21.908
Uh, there's pasta salad
in the fridge.

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.618
Chicken, no feta.

00:28:23.785 --> 00:28:24.953
Oh yeah? From where?

00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:26.955
From me. I made it.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.710
You did?

00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:33.336
Mm-hmm.

00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:35.839
I'm not just a pretty face.

00:28:35.964 --> 00:28:38.174
Oh, but you're
a very pretty face.

00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:43.680
What's that?

00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:45.432
It's an artist I love.

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:46.599
He has a new show out.

00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:47.809
- Oh, cool.
- Mm-hmm.

00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:49.269
I should buy some art.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.813
What?

00:28:51.938 --> 00:28:53.356
Hey, I'm not just
a pretty face either.

00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:54.649
No, no, no, no.

00:28:54.816 --> 00:28:57.068
You're also
a very, very hot body.

00:28:57.193 --> 00:28:58.361
Hey!

00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:13.334
We don't have to do this.

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.879
It's cool.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.339
OK.

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:27.015
This would look great
in the living room.

00:29:27.182 --> 00:29:30.018
Not on the fireplace wall,
but on the way to the bedroom.

00:29:30.143 --> 00:29:31.519
I think it would--
- Shhh!

00:29:33.897 --> 00:29:36.357
Sorry. Sorry, I just...

00:29:36.524 --> 00:29:40.612
It's OK.
Um, maybe we should...

00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:42.030
Amazing, isn't it?

00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:43.865
Yeah, it's beautiful.

00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:49.370
So, are you two just browsing
or shopping to buy?

00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:50.705
Oh, I think we're...

00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:52.874
Yeah, I think we're just
browsing right now. Yeah.

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:54.834
- Thank you, though.
- Excuse me.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.297
Sorry, he's not feeling well.

00:29:59.422 --> 00:30:00.381
No problem.

00:30:11.851 --> 00:30:13.937
I'm, uh, I'm really sorry.

00:30:14.896 --> 00:30:16.397
I thought I could do that.

00:30:16.523 --> 00:30:19.192
I really thought I could.
I wanted to. I just...

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:20.401
It's OK.

00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:22.070
No, it's not.

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:24.739
I know it's not.

00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:26.074
Come here. Come here.

00:30:52.725 --> 00:30:55.103
These road trips
are just killing me.

00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:56.563
I mean, it's brutal.

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:57.939
I think I'm cursed.

00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.065
Cursed?

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.192
Like, scary old lady cursed?

00:31:01.317 --> 00:31:02.902
I know. I know it's dumb.

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:05.613
But I'm not the only one
who's superstitious.

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:07.991
Would you be jealous

00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:10.368
if I got my smoothies
from some other guy?

00:31:10.493 --> 00:31:12.203
Maybe. Probably.

00:31:12.328 --> 00:31:15.540
Well, what if I filled you in
on all the juicy details?

00:31:15.665 --> 00:31:17.000
Like, how he blended them?

00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:20.044
What if it actually
was a scary old lady?

00:31:20.169 --> 00:31:22.839
Or what if you always
kind of had one with you?

00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:24.465
What do you mean?

00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:25.925
Ah.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.510
Here.

00:31:32.473 --> 00:31:34.267
OK, I know it's dumb.
I know it's dumb.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:35.727
But I saw them at a bodega,

00:31:35.852 --> 00:31:38.021
and I thought they looked like
your smoothie.

00:31:43.818 --> 00:31:45.486
- I love them.
- Yeah?

00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:46.988
I love them so much.

00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:55.622
Can I fuck you?

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.290
Absolutely.

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.017
Fuck yes!

00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:17.560
<i>That's two tonight.</i>

00:32:17.685 --> 00:32:19.854
<i>Can we say it out loud?
Is the curse broken?</i>

00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:23.316
<i>Hunter hasn't scored twice in
an away game since last season.</i>

00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:30.531
What?

00:32:30.698 --> 00:32:31.950
Say it out loud.

00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:34.285
Say what?

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.956
Ah, OK, it's not...

00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:40.959
It's what?

00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:44.379
OK, here's what I know.
- Elena...

00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:46.714
Shut up,
you're in love with him.

00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:48.049
I'm not in love with him.

00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:49.592
You are.

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.513
Have you at least told your dad?

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:58.184
For how long now?

00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.769
A little over two months.

00:32:59.894 --> 00:33:01.062
Oh, baby.

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:03.481
Elena, hey,
you--you can't tell.

00:33:03.606 --> 00:33:06.234
If anyone finds out that it...
- That it's Scott?

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:09.529
Obviously, I'm not gonna
tell anyone, but Kip...

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:11.531
He can't come out
right now, OK?

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:12.740
He really wants to.

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:16.244
It's amazing. He's amazing.

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.621
And I've never been happier.

00:33:19.747 --> 00:33:21.332
Honestly.

00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:25.753
What's the plan, babe?

00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:29.757
I don't...
I don't know.

00:33:29.924 --> 00:33:31.509
What does your dad think?

00:33:31.634 --> 00:33:35.722
That I'm fucking some
married guy, probably.

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.140
Kind of wish you were.

00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:39.851
Ah. Just don't
say that, please.

00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:42.395
Just please be happy for me.

00:33:44.772 --> 00:33:47.525
I can't wait to see you
in a tux tomorrow night.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.736
I am gonna be super
well behaved for you.

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:51.612
I only care
that you're handsome.

00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:53.197
You bitch.

00:33:54.949 --> 00:33:56.993
Scott's gonna be there
tomorrow night too.

00:33:57.118 --> 00:33:58.119
Oh, I know.

00:33:58.244 --> 00:34:00.121
And he better be ready for me.

00:34:32.278 --> 00:34:33.654
Hey, Dad.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.490
<i>Oh my God!
You're not dead!</i>

00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:36.491
No, I'm alive.

00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:38.242
<i>Well, that is a relief.</i>

00:34:38.367 --> 00:34:39.911
<i>I didn't want to
have to call the morgue.</i>

00:34:40.036 --> 00:34:41.079
<i>You know, I miss you.</i>

00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:42.872
I miss you too, Dad.

00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:44.415
- <i>All right.</i>
- Yeah.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.250
<i>You gonna be
making an appearance here</i>

00:34:46.375 --> 00:34:47.710
<i>at some point
in the near future?</i>

00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:49.337
Yes, I will.

00:34:49.462 --> 00:34:52.131
Um, I'm gonna come for
dinner this week, I promise.

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:53.216
<i>Perfect.</i>

00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:55.009
How's, uh, how's work?

00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:58.221
<i>Well, work is fine. You know,
Barry's being a pain in my ass.</i>

00:34:58.346 --> 00:34:59.722
Well, Barry's an asshole.

00:34:59.847 --> 00:35:01.349
<i>No, he hurt his foot.</i>

00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:02.767
<i>So at least there's
something new this time.</i>

00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:04.894
Yeah, well, Barry's
always been an asshole.

00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:07.105
<i>Who taught you
to talk like that?</i>

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.357
You did. You taught me
to talk like that.

00:35:09.524 --> 00:35:10.733
<i>That sounds about right.</i>

00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:14.695
And, uh, nothing
in the mail, right?

00:35:14.862 --> 00:35:16.864
<i>Kip, if there was something
in the mail,</i>

00:35:16.989 --> 00:35:18.658
<i>I would not have
forgotten about it.</i>

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.119
I know, I know.
I just figured I'd check.

00:35:21.244 --> 00:35:23.788
<i>OK. Don't worry about that.</i>

00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:24.997
OK.

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:26.541
<i>Don't think about that, OK?</i>

00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:28.292
<i>It's gonna come when it comes.</i>

00:35:28.417 --> 00:35:30.044
<i>Look, I'm not gonna keep you.
I love you.</i>

00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:31.504
All right. You too, Dad.

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.714
<i>You too, Dad, what?</i>

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.550
I love you too, Dad.

00:35:35.675 --> 00:35:37.593
There, I said it.
Oh my God.

00:35:37.718 --> 00:35:39.554
- <i>Sorry it's such a struggle.</i>
- OK.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.389
- <i>OK, bye!</i>
- Bye-bye!

00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:39.989
Stop it.

00:36:40.114 --> 00:36:41.532
Stop what?

00:36:43.117 --> 00:36:44.285
He's here.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:45.620
You need to chill out.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.624
My God!

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.293
Can I have some of yours?

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.961
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:58.633
Well, I like our
playoff chances this year.

00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:01.010
I think we might even get
some home ice advantage.

00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:02.470
Well, if this guy

00:37:02.595 --> 00:37:04.305
keeps playing
the way he has been, maybe.

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.723
What changed?

00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:07.934
You meet a nice girl
or something?

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.645
I think we just found
our groove as a team.

00:37:11.979 --> 00:37:15.066
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I think I spotted an old friend.

00:37:15.191 --> 00:37:16.984
I'm just ribbing you, Scott.

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:19.904
You know your parents would
be so proud of you, right?

00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:21.197
Your mom especially.

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:23.407
She would have
just been thrilled.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:26.035
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.246
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:32.166
Hey. You OK?

00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:33.334
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:35.336
I should be used to it.

00:37:40.841 --> 00:37:42.343
Kip, right?

00:37:44.136 --> 00:37:46.347
Christopher
when he's all dressed up.

00:37:46.514 --> 00:37:47.682
I'm Elena.

00:37:47.848 --> 00:37:49.267
Nice to meet you, Elena.
I'm Scott.

00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:50.851
Pleasure, Scott.

00:37:51.018 --> 00:37:53.646
You look beautiful.
You both do.

00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:55.022
Uh, sorry.

00:37:56.357 --> 00:37:58.401
Yeah, we both
clean up pretty well.

00:38:02.738 --> 00:38:04.115
OK, if I go get more drinks,

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.409
do you promise to
start talking, Christopher?

00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:07.368
- Of course.
- Great.

00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:08.536
Another beer, Scott?

00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:10.579
That'd be lovely, thank you.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.878
Are you enjoying the evening?

00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:20.214
I am. Are you?

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:24.051
Looking forward to
the after party, honestly.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:28.889
Tux fits perfectly.

00:38:29.056 --> 00:38:30.224
Thanks.

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:31.392
And thanks.

00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:33.477
I mean, you didn't have to.

00:38:33.602 --> 00:38:35.313
I wanted to.

00:38:38.065 --> 00:38:39.900
You OK?

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.862
Elena knows.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.572
I'm--I'm sorry.

00:38:44.697 --> 00:38:47.033
Yeah, kind of got that.

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.784
It's, uh, it's OK.

00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:51.203
She's, uh,
she's discreet, right?

00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:52.747
Yeah, totally, totally.

00:38:52.913 --> 00:38:54.915
I just, I, she kind of
figured it out,

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:57.501
and I guess
I had to tell someone.

00:38:57.626 --> 00:39:00.087
It's OK. Really.

00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:06.093
This is so weird.

00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:09.930
Yeah. We should leave early,
as soon as I do my speech.

00:39:10.056 --> 00:39:12.016
Uh, not before
you dance with me.

00:39:12.141 --> 00:39:13.100
Pardon?

00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:14.435
I wanna dance.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.395
Elena's a killer.

00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:20.024
How could I possibly say no?

00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:24.820
So?

00:39:24.945 --> 00:39:26.906
What are your intentions
with my Kip?

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.367
I'm serious.

00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:30.785
He's crazy about you.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.286
I'm crazy about him too.

00:39:32.453 --> 00:39:33.621
I really am.

00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.456
He's also miserable.

00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:38.584
Are you miserable too?

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.587
No.

00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:45.383
Wait, what do you mean?

00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.635
Nobody wants to be
kept a secret.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.637
- He's not a...
- He is.

00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:52.807
Eyes on me, handsome.

00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:56.185
I'm doing my best.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.479
I--I love him.

00:39:58.604 --> 00:40:00.856
I just can't do
better right now.

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:03.275
I've been honest.
- I know.

00:40:04.527 --> 00:40:05.694
<i>And he's so in love with you</i>

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.488
<i>that he'll put up with it.</i>

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.117
<i>But it's killing him.</i>

00:40:15.621 --> 00:40:18.999
<i>I'm not saying any of this
to be mean, I'm really not.</i>

00:40:19.166 --> 00:40:20.501
<i>And you seem great.</i>

00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.003
<i>But he's great too.</i>

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.926
<i>He deserves the best.</i>

00:40:31.137 --> 00:40:32.972
He deserves sunshine.

00:40:43.274 --> 00:40:45.192
And so do you.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:54.410
It's my birthday on Sunday.

00:40:54.535 --> 00:40:55.786
I know.

00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:57.705
I've already got
the caterer lined up.

00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:01.083
Surf and turf.
Because we're not choosing.

00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.503
You know The Kingfisher?

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:07.590
It's the bar I told you about
where I watch all your games.

00:41:07.715 --> 00:41:09.133
Mm-hmm.

00:41:09.258 --> 00:41:10.718
A couple of my friends

00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:12.845
are throwing me just, like,
a little party there.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.555
It's not even really a party.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.891
It's just hanging out
or whatever.

00:41:17.016 --> 00:41:17.892
Right.

00:41:18.017 --> 00:41:19.768
It's a--it's a gay bar,

00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:22.980
but it's not a club,
it's just a bar.

00:41:23.105 --> 00:41:25.483
It's honestly more of a
hockey bar now, thanks to me.

00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:27.234
Kip...

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:30.654
And I was thinking that you
could just come as my friend,

00:41:30.779 --> 00:41:32.781
as somebody who
buys smoothies from me.

00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:35.826
I mean, Maria knows,
my friend Sean knows.

00:41:35.951 --> 00:41:39.163
They know that you buy
smoothies from me.

00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:44.877
I can't.

00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:47.713
I can't do that.

00:41:49.715 --> 00:41:51.217
I wish I could.

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.927
I--I want to.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.055
I want to tell everyone.

00:41:57.264 --> 00:42:01.060
I want people to know
you're mine, that I love you.

00:42:02.269 --> 00:42:03.729
I love you too.

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:05.523
Soon, maybe.

00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:10.778
In a few years.

00:42:14.573 --> 00:42:16.075
No, I know,
I know how it sounds.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.245
But it'll go by quickly,
I promise.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:23.207
And then we can be normal,
like--like other people.

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.547
I heard what you said
in your speech tonight.

00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:33.717
And I know that
they're your family

00:42:33.842 --> 00:42:36.220
and that you feel
responsible for them,

00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:37.471
and I get that, Scott.

00:42:37.596 --> 00:42:40.724
I really, really
get that, but...

00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:44.895
I have a family too.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.316
And I keep lying to them,
and I don't want to.

00:42:51.193 --> 00:42:52.403
And I miss them.

00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:54.280
I miss my dad.

00:42:55.698 --> 00:42:57.992
Sorry, that's not what I meant.

00:42:58.158 --> 00:43:00.828
It's OK.
I know what you meant.

00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:06.000
I'm gonna go home tonight.

00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.253
I need to.

00:43:35.362 --> 00:43:37.698
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:40.326
Thank you for coming.

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.536
For those of you
who've attended before,

00:43:42.703 --> 00:43:45.706
feel free to ignore my sob story
and go straight to the bar.

00:43:47.207 --> 00:43:48.876
But for those of you
who don't know it,

00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:50.961
here's the short version.

00:43:52.338 --> 00:43:55.966
My parents were both
junior hockey coaches,

00:43:56.091 --> 00:43:58.719
and they were hit
by a drunk driver

00:43:58.844 --> 00:44:00.346
when I was 12 years old.

00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:04.892
Mercifully for them,
they died instantly.

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:07.102
Mercifully for me,

00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:10.314
the St. Thomas
scholarships existed.

00:44:11.357 --> 00:44:14.568
<i>I didn't have
anybody else to help me.</i>

00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:18.155
<i>I had a lot of memories,
a love of hockey</i>

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.075
<i>and a huge hole in my heart.</i>

00:44:22.576 --> 00:44:26.997
<i>St. Thomas filled it with hope,
the hope of a new family.</i>

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:30.250
Things weren't always easy.

00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:32.378
You know, they never are
for anybody.

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.588
But in hockey,

00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:36.799
I found what I was missing,

00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:38.509
first at my high school,

00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:42.179
then later at college,
and now here with the Admirals.

00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:47.309
And I never looked back
because I--I never had to.

00:44:49.061 --> 00:44:50.646
<i>The family I craved,</i>

00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:54.108
<i>the family that I needed,
that I still need today...</i>

00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:57.277
<i>hockey gave it to me.</i>

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.447
<i>And St. Thomas gave me hockey.</i>

00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:03.867
So from the bottom of my heart,

00:45:03.992 --> 00:45:06.704
I want to thank you all
for being here tonight

00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:08.247
and for supporting this cause,

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.916
because it's not just
a scholarship, it's...

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.876
It's everything
that comes with it.

00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:15.212
It's a whole world,
a whole life.

00:45:15.337 --> 00:45:16.463
It's...

00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:20.300
It's everything.

00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:40.237
Kip!

00:45:40.362 --> 00:45:41.488
Hey, Dad.

00:45:41.613 --> 00:45:44.241
Hey, buddy.
The prodigal son returned home.

00:45:44.366 --> 00:45:47.619
Look, I got some mail here
for a certain someone,

00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.621
and it's pretty heavy.

00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.498
I want...

00:45:53.167 --> 00:45:54.418
Hey...

00:45:58.672 --> 00:46:00.132
Hey.

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.425
My boy.

00:46:02.551 --> 00:46:04.052
Come here. What's up?

00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:05.304
Whoa.

00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:06.513
Hey.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.056
I'm sorry.

00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:10.517
For what? You got nothing
to be sorry for, silly.

00:46:11.685 --> 00:46:12.853
Oh...

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.023
Hey...

00:46:19.485 --> 00:46:20.569
OK, OK, here we go!

00:46:20.694 --> 00:46:21.862
- Oh!
- Happy...

00:46:21.987 --> 00:46:23.363
No, wait! No, wait!

00:46:23.489 --> 00:46:24.990
Here's to turning 26,

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:28.202
and a full fucking ride
to grad school!

00:46:30.496 --> 00:46:33.415
Yeah!

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.085
