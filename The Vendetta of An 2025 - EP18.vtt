[The Vendetta of An]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.390
Chancellor Gao,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020
I am deeply grateful for your help

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.130
these past days.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.820
No need to thank me.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.850
If anything,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.260
I am the one who owes you.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.930
I was too wary of you

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.130
back then.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.340
You are His Majesty's strategist.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.290
You shoulder the fate of the realm.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.560
It was right for you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.010
to be cautious of me.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.570
Hearing you say so

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.850
and thinking

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.450
of the steamed buns

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.170
I've been sending you this past month,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.780
I can finally feel at ease.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.610
It's been over a month.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.660
Is your hand

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.200
healed?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.490
Yes.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.170
And your legs?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.410
Probably

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.260
about the same as yours.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.660
It is already midnight.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.540
Time is running short.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.340
But at least

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.660
it is a gentle night.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.700
[Episode 18]

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.610
What is this?

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.730
It reads like a farewell letter.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.950
And he tells us not to worry?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.860
Stop worrying.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.540
Huai'an will be all right.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.850
Sir.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.980
[Cangyue Tower]

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.580
Mr. Wuyin.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.490
Please rest here.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.930
At dawn tomorrow,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.690
General Fengshan

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:21.660
will personally wait for you

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.450
outside the Taiqing Hall.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.480
Sir,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.040
don't be uneasy about tonight.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.300
I will stand guard.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.660
I'm not uneasy.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.740
I'm simply wondering

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.010
why a prosperous city like Chang'an

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.740
produces such people.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.490
A slave girl who could play the guqin turned out

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.620
to be an assassin.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.190
A laborer

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.910
who can tell the Tiemo people apart turned out

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.010
to be the mastermind.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:25.870
And then there's Yan Fengshan.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.370
He wants to borrow my troops

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.810
to attack his own city.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.130
Dealing with these people

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.010
is exhausting.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.300
That's enough for today.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.830
You should rest early as well.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.220
Yes, sir.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.100
As long as you keep quiet,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.250
you will be fine.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.060
We go way back.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.570
I have something

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.780
to discuss with you.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.490
Don't breathe into my palm.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.740
Two men alone in the dark

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.220
at this hour

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.290
are strange enough as it is.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.800
Stop laughing.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.060
I'm going to move my hand away.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.530
As long as you don't shout,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.660
my axe

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.690
will stay where it is.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.450
Come on.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.920
At least let me light a candle

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.360
so I can see

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.650
which old acquaintance you are.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.200
We're two grown men

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.620
alone in the dark.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.740
It's pretty strange.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.010
Don't mimic me.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.690
Fine.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.030
I don't recognize you.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.980
Hold on.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.420
I'm not some maiden.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.010
Why the rush?

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.150
Your tone

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.020
sounds familiar.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.100
Why can't I place it?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.500
Be patient.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.370
You'll know soon enough.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.960
This is starting to feel strange again.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.490
I still don't recognize you.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.060
Wuyin Chong,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.300
you came to Chang'an as a secret envoy

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.570
and the Tiemo prince,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.850
so I will meet you as the Emperor

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.610
of Chang'an.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.610
I just want you to know

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.850
that I am still alive.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.430
The Xiao imperial line still has a survivor.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.460
Whatever you discussed with that traitor

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.330
Yan Fengshan

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.310
won't count.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.690
We do go way back.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.480
The whole world believes you died

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.700
in the palace fire.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.060
Who would have thought?

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.240
The look in your eyes,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.950
the way you speak,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.480
and even the way you do things

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.780
have all changed.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.680
But you are the Emperor of Chang'an.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.120
Why hide your own face?

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.300
Why do you think?

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.810
To protect myself, of course,

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.660
while I deal with Yan Fengshan.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.210
Just as you said,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.160
you are now nothing more

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.450
than a fugitive trying to stay alive.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.050
What right do you have to replace Yan Fengshan

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.010
and make a pact with me?

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.090
You call yourself an emperor,

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.980
but do you have any force to command?

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.250
Xie Huai'an truly

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.990
is the smartest man in the world.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.380
He even guessed every sentence

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.030
and every word

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.120
you were going to say.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.810
It's the Chou hour.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:40.850
Come with me.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.090
I'll show you

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.700
the force I command.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.420
Enjoy, sirs.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.940
Why are you staring at me?

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.300
Your force isn't here yet anyway.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.080
Who says?

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.880
Listen.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.950
That is just one of my guards.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:32.970
He is there

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.000
to keep you

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.570
from trying anything.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.970
Listen more closely.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.570
Rumor has it Chang'an fell into chaos last month.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.080
Xiao Wuyang and Gu Yu vanished,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.360
their fate unknown.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.600
The great strategist Gao Yan

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.930
had his legs broken.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.370
He moves on a cart now

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.110
and is kept in the palace

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.060
as a lantern keeper,

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.590
only allowed out at the Chou hour to deliver

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.440
memorials to Yan Fengshan.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.460
That Xie Huai'an you mentioned

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.340
managed to get Gao Yan out.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.180
It is truly remarkable.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.140
I am that force.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.960
The Xiao imperial line still has a survivor,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.210
and Gu Yu of the Baiwenhu Army still lives.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.210
Chang'an

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.180
is not yet ruled by Yan Fengshan.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.240
Whatever pact

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.270
you plan to make with him tomorrow

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.980
will not stand.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.610
Chang'an

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.140
will change hands again,

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.380
and the fight will be against Yan Fengshan.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.920
If you make a pact with him,

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.210
the north will also change hands,

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.690
and the fight will be against you.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.090
General Gu,

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.340
my people and yours

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.320
have fought for years.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.250
We have never feared you.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.040
His Majesty,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.330
I,

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.210
and the entire city of Chang'an

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.970
have been pressed

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.730
to this state by Yan Fengshan,

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.210
but we have not been defeated.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.690
You are not fearless.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.500
You fear the one

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.450
who has been planning all of this for us.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.500
Xie Huai'an

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.300
is the son of Liu Ziwen.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.480
He's the one who gave you a new face

00:17:07.481 --> 00:17:27.595
(Watch on www.dramacool.club Support Admin)

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.360
and the one who helped you survive.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:12.670
Am I right?

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.380
Yes.

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.260
The last two generations of the Liu family

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.130
produced extraordinary men in succession.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.890
They have used up decades of Chang'an's fortune.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.270
I understand now.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.460
This is the most unforgettable night of my life.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.060
Tonight has made me

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.410
fall in love with Chang'an all over again.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:03.960
Your Majesty,

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.530
it has been a long time.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.140
We actually met before.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.310
You simply didn't know it was me.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.770
Keeping you hidden by his side

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.200
was indeed the best strategy.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.260
But according to the plan,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.950
he should already be in Yan Fengshan's hands now.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.730
On the road to killing Yan Fengshan,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.090
all of us must pay a price.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.620
May I have that flask of wine?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.220
Is it for Chancellor Gao?

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.140
The man in the drawing

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.330
represents my wish for you.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:05.660
I hope you can tend flowers,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.770
keep a cat,

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.140
nap on the porch,

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.660
and live in peace,

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.810
even for just one day.

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.950
You're awake.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.460
The General has gone to the palace to meet Wuyin Chong.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.240
He instructed me

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.550
to treat you as a guest.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.220
I brought you a basin of water

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.790
to wipe the blood off.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.090
You knew she was buried here?

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.290
Yes.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.080
And you still chose

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.180
to stay in this residence?

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:41.330
Yes.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.220
Were you involved

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.420
in her death as well?

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:57.920
Take care.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:58.880
Goodbye.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.130
Yes.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.660
Then you, too, must die.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.030
[For Liu Ziwen Only]

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.090
This is my plan.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.250
It...

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.970
it is far too risky.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.680
Back then,

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.280
you did not help my father get rid of Yan Fengshan.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:01.810
I will not question

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.610
your reasons.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.240
It is

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:12.780
only natural for people

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.650
to put themselves first.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.260
I am using your guilt

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.850
toward the Liu family

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:23.220
to force your hand.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.780
I am the one going too far.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.020
Mr. Yang.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.370
We act at the Chou hour.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:49.760
By the Yin hour,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.300
Yan Fengshan will have received the news

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.420
and realized

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.650
you were involved.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.980
You must leave as soon as possible.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.930
Zhu Zhilong will be waiting for you

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:02.970
at the Yuelao Temple 50 li west of the city.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.800
After this,

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.010
your business

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.900
in Chang'an and elsewhere

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.140
will certainly be affected.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.600
If I win in the future,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.640
I will repay

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.330
every loss you suffer.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.490
Boss.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.220
Boss,

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.380
what's going on?

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.940
Is the court cleaning house?

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.490
The books we cannot let anyone see

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.010
are over there.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.050
I'll get them.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.660
Here.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.360
Here.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:57.810
Boss,

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.280
what is wrong with you?

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:31.730
General Fengshan,

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.460
my master says

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.610
the agreement you and he were about to reach

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.310
does not align with Tiemo's interests,

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:38.640
so it will be set aside for now.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.510
But the army we sent

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:43.320
to hold back the Baiwenhu Army

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:44.980
will not retreat.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.910
Everything will remain as it is.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.010
General,

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:49.420
you may rest assured.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.050
I see.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:56.910
The struggle for Chang'an

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:57.960
is not yet over.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.480
My master hopes you will soon become

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.180
the one who rules Chang'an.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:10.810
Old friend,

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.500
do not worry about the outcome anymore.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.370
Rest in peace.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.130
General Fengshan.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.610
This life-and-death plan of Gao Yan's

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.610
was executed flawlessly

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.700
with the people outside.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.570
You were the one handling

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.090
all the message delivery, weren't you?

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.890
So Gu Yu had been

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.410
hiding here

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.460
for over a month?

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.960
No wonder even after searching all of Chang'an,

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.780
we never found a trace.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.100
Gao Yan and Gu Yu actually joined hands.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.130
I accept my loss

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:39.700
in this round.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.850
Stop pretending.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.130
A man who has served three emperors

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.290
has eyes sharper than a blade.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.920
You know perfectly well

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.500
whether I intend to kill you.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.700
Your eyes are sharp too, General.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.020
All I did was sigh once while wiping the floor,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.020
and you noticed immediately.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.020
When you were setting this up,

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.850
White Hair had already fallen into my hands.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.850
Otherwise,

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.650
I truly would have killed you.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.780
I helped you get into the palace

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.020
so you could live out your years in peace.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.570
This is a good place to rest and be idle.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:40.570
Stay here and behave yourself.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.890
Sir.

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.410
Come in.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.350
I have conveyed

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.670
your message to Yan Fengshan.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:07.970
But

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.310
Yan Fengshan has always been scheming and calculating.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.640
Given the situation,

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.210
we should return to Tiemo as soon as possible.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.250
I understand what you mean,

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.770
but Yan Fengshan

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.280
would not dare move against us.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:22.940
Even so, it is time to head back.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.460
[Fuze Inn]

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.370
This is a rare treat

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.940
in Chang'an.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.580
Want one?

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.100
Sure.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.770
This end

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.420
is very bitter.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.060
You shouldn't

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:22.730
chew too much of it,

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.250
or all you'll taste

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.290
is bitterness.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.770
Of course I know that.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.390
Twenty-five years ago,

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.210
I infiltrated Tiemo as a scout.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.980
I barely had any money.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.020
It was freezing there,

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.810
and chewing this was how I kept warm and stayed awake.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.170
It used to be cheaper than horse fodder.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.290
But now the price has gone up.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.950
A small bundle

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.210
costs two liang.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.980
At your request, the Tiemo forces have been

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.620
locked in a standoff with the Baiwenhu Army.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.480
They've been so close

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.040
their horses are all but nose to nose.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:00.930
With things so tense,

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.900
few merchants dare travel back and forth.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.690
The supply is unstable,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.210
and naturally,

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.460
the price rises.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:12.290
Last night, you staged quite a show.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.730
You convinced Wuyin Chong.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.940
The sharp merchants

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.130
will soon realize

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.500
the Tiemo forces will not march south.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:22.440
When that happens,

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.590
the price will naturally fall again.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.900
The whole game has been thrown into chaos,

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.730
yet you seem remarkably calm.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.020
Victory and defeat are commonplace in warfare.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.210
One who cares too much about gains and losses

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.380
cannot be a true commander.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.220
Speaking of which,

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.940
you cling to gains and losses quite a bit.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.500
You buried Wei Qianting,

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.090
sent Pu Nichuan to his death,

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.210
and killed Liu Ziyan with your own hands.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.460
Qingyi has vanished,

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.420
and even Wang Pu was outwitted and killed by you.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.250
All I have left beside me is Zhiying.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.290
Do you intend to kill her too?

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.340
Of course.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.900
I care deeply

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.090
about settling scores.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.890
On the road of revenge,

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:41.530
I cannot allow

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.420
even one enemy to meet a good end.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.940
And don't forget.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.820
You're one of them too.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.250
Then

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.900
why didn't you kill Yang Chuhao?

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:25.900
He stood by and did nothing.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.060
That is not a crime deserving death.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.730
I still

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.900
have my principles.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.900
Back then, he stood by and did nothing.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.090
Last night, he chose to help you.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.420
I have my principles too.

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.900
He

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.820
will not have a peaceful end.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.020
Too bad you won't find him.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.020
Speaking of which,

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:03.560
there is a young man surnamed Su

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.100
working under Yang Chuhao.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:07.650
Do you remember him?

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:11.470
We met once.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.030
I looked into him.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.770
He is not a Huben member.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.460
Among everyone involved in Yang's business,

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.920
Yang himself is the only Huben member.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.710
That boy truly is not.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.610
Anyone who can catch your eye

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.380
must have some wits.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.800
To work for Yang Chuhao

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.500
and even handle something as important as the accounts,

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.150
wits alone aren't enough.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.060
He must also have a story behind him.
