Miss.

You asked me to get some snacks.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.800
But inside the snack box,
there's this thing.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.199
It's Young Master's jade pendant.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.240
Master placed it on him.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.279

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.199

Xiao Huaijin is

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.720
using Yunqi to trick me.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.000

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.600
one step away from finding Yunqi.

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:57.240

Like shooting fish in a barrel.

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:10.079
He thinks he is setting a trap.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.680
But he didn't know

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.720
I'm letting him do it.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:15.279
This is

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.360

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.279

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.120

We watch from the shadows.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.040

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.199
Every day is the same.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.800

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.000

Xiao Huaijin is
hollowed out by debauchery.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.560

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.279
It's too dangerous.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.959
I will go with you.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.360
Xiao Huaijin doesn't know

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.360
I've found him.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.319
I'll scout ahead.

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.879
I need you to do
something more important.

- My Lord.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.240

00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:54.399
Be cautious.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.199

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.000

What do you think?

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.720
I advise you not to come closer.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.480
Swords have no eyes.

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:01.559

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:04.559
fight me.

Pei Yu.

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:11.000
His Majesty ordered you
to hunt the Shen's fugitive.

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:13.440
Yet here you are sheltering them.

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:15.559
How

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:17.759
should His Majesty punish you?

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:19.799

00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:21.159
no Shen's fugitive here.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.879
But you, you are killing the innocents.

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:26.000
Even if I kill you here,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.039
His Majesty won't hold me accountable.

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:29.240
Is that so?

00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:32.799
You will have to survive me first.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.480
Release her,

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:38.840
and I will leave your corpse intact.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.279
Intact?

00:10:40.879 --> 00:10:43.320
You think you are in a position to negotiate?

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:46.440
Fine.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.639
I shall offer you one more chance.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.360

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:54.600

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.080
