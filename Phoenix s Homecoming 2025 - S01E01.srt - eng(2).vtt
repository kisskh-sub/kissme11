=Episode 1=

00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:02.095
(Weiyang Palace)

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.319
Grand Tutor Xie, how come
you're in the mood

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.000
for playing the zither for a "traitor"

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:22.280
like me

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.840
(Grand Tutor, Xie Fei)
instead of attending to state affairs?

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:29.400
(Grand Princess, Sheng Yunlin)
Do you also wish to warm my bed?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.359
You have already

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.280
declined the imperial marriage proposal.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.239
Your Highness,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.040
I see you as my soulmate.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.480
Are you trying to be my soulmate,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.079
defying all convention?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.879
Are you really trying to be my lover

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.239
after what you've done today?

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:53.400
I came to present

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.719
tonic for your health, Your Highness.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Your Highness,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.120
do you know what I truly want?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.319
Do you want me,

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.560
the convicted Princess,

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:15.960
to die?

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.639
Your Majesty,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.240
the Grand Princess secretly

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.639
(Sheng Yunlin)
corresponded with King Liang of Qi.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.960
When did I ever correspond with him?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.800
Utter nonsense!

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.039
It is indeed her handwriting.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.520
Grand Tutor Xie,

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.400
what should we do about it?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.719
In my opinion,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.319
the crime of treason

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.759
calls for

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.039
confinement within Weiyang Palace.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.639
(If not for your blunt words
this morning,)

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.039
(how would I bear the charge of treason)

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:48.800
(and be grounded?)

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.240
Rest assured.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.080
If you die,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.759
I will die with you

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:05.520
today.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.400
I won't drink it.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.439
(If this tonic is poisoned,)

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.199
(then I will die)

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.879
(with Your Highness.)

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.919
(The court situation is complex.)

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.376
(You must withdraw from the fray)

00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:50.719
(and bide your time.)

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.919
(Bide my time?)

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.639
(Will I even survive this?)

00:03:58.048 --> 00:03:58.599
(Remnants of the Sheng army are in Qi)

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.759
(Her life and the honor)

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.719
(of the Sheng family)

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.280
(all rest upon me.)

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.560
Get my horse.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.840
I'm heading to Qi right now.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.479
(Wait for me.)

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.759
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees:

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.439
The Regent Princess Sheng Yunlin

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.199
colluded with enemies,
harmed the state and its people,

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:28.920
(Chief Eunuch, Feng Yuan)
and shall be executed.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.439
Are you looking for me, Your Highness?

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:42.639
What a pity.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.439
You are no longer

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.439
(Imperial Guard, Su Wei)
my master.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.199
Su Wei.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.839
You traitor.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.639
How dare you hurt

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:56.120
Her Highness?

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:04.399
Madam.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.839
Your Highness.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.920
You must live well.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.639
Madam.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.120
You are no longer

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.360
the lofty Regent Princess above us all.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.560
A traitor deserves to die.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.399
Who drugged me?

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.120
I did, Your Highness.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.120
How did the wine taste?

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:02.560
(I've devoted myself to the Chen State.)

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.759
(Is this... how it ends?)

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.639
(Huaiyong, where are you?)

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.560
(The Regent Princess Sheng Yunlin)

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.240
(was convicted of treason)

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.199
(and committed suicide by fire
in the Weiyang Palace.)

00:08:30.395 --> 00:08:31.879
(Grave of the Grand Princess
Sheng Yunlin)

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:32.720
(Why?)

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.000
(Why must fate toy with us?)

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.799
(I'm sorry.)

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.960
(I'm sorry, Your Highness.)

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.000
(I arrived too late.)

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:48.720
(I'm always one step behind.)

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.799
(Your Highness.)

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:54.360
(Your Highness.)

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:57.639
Your Highness.

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:04.496
(Grave of the Grand Princess
Sheng Yunlin)

00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:07.631
(Three Years Later)

00:10:09.044 --> 00:10:11.440
(Chengfeng Pavilion)

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.399
You said that
the Grand Princess had colluded

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:14.200
with the enemies,

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:16.639
and no one would want her belongings.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.679
Why are you here?

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.120
She was a real beauty.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.000
Many covet

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.200
her jade pendant.

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:25.039
She lured His Majesty with her beauty.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.919
Otherwise,

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:30.559
why had His Majesty entrusted her

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:32.000
with all that power?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.200
Not only that,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.559
she also abducted
common men for her harem.

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:40.919
Every night, she would

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:43.679
absorb yang energy to nourish her yin.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.080
Who dares attack me?

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.399
Who dares attack me?

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:56.679
Grand Tutor Xie.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.519
What are you doing here?

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.799
Grand Tutor Xie.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:04.960
Wait.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.399
Now you're just a commoner.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.879
You're also here
for the Phoenix Pendant?

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:12.440
Speaking of which,

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:15.080
the Princess was once your student.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.080
Truly,

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:20.759
a master makes a fine disciple.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.720
Speaking of the past,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.039
wasn't the Grand Princess
your master, Lord Su?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.080
Now that your master is gone,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.759
how come you're
clinging to life, Lord Su?

00:11:36.559 --> 00:11:37.039
You...

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:41.480
Her bones rest beneath the earth.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.840
Her spirit lingers in her old chamber.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.039
My sister, the Grand Princess,
has passed away.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.519
I implore you to stop arguing.

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:58.080
Do not disturb her over an object.

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:05.919
This Phoenix Pendant
is a relic of the Grand Princess.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.879
Those who bear grudges against her

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.000
should not covet this item,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.679
lest they bring disaster
upon themselves.

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:16.639
No way.

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:19.600
Are we seeing a ghost?

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.559
Don't panic.

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:23.960
We saw her die with our own eyes.

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:25.320
This can't be her.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.240
I have work to do.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.840
Count me out.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.360
Please have fun.

00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:42.480
Lord Su.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.639
Aren't we going to drink together?

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:46.200
Why are you leaving so soon?

00:12:49.759 --> 00:12:50.840
She has to die.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.639
Send someone to kill her.

00:12:53.159 --> 00:12:54.080
My lord.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.879
My lord, what should we do?

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.600
Find a way to bring her back

00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:01.080
and finish her off.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.240
What?

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:10.879
You...

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.320
My lord.

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.240
Are you trying to seize it

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.600
without placing the bids?

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.120
Fine.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:31.919
One thousand taels of gold.

00:13:34.879 --> 00:13:36.120
Three thousand.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.799
And I want you to come with me.
