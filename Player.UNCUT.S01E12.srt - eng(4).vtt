- (Previously on "Player")
- Even if there’s only one percent

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.920
left of what you still feel for me,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.800
I won’t let go.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.160
Can you just stop bothering me?

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.320
We’ve been through a lot.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.640
I’m sorry everything turned out this way.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.120
You wouldn’t understand

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.240
what it's like to feel unimportant.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.160
That place you keep saying
you’re stuck in the middle,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.040
I’m there with you.
Dad and Mom are there with you too.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.560
I’ve always been proud of you, Pun.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.920
Ploy gave me that million
to pass it on to you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.360
To test whether you’d choose her or the money.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.840
If there’s anyone who knows her best,
it’s you, isn’t it?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.040
I’m really sorry.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.800
You can trust me, Ploy.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.760
I do trust you.

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.880
People from New York!

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.680
Run!

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.920
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.600
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.120
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.000
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.320
♫ The closer we become ♫

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.479
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.479
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.080
♫ Game for your love ♫

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.760
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.880
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.199
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.480

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.360
What? Where’s everyone gone?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960
Hello?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.760
No one’s here.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.400
Ahem.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.920
How did you get here?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.200
I came to watch those two fall in love.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.120
Hope it’s real love, though.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.720
I’ve got a really bad feeling about this.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.320
Oh, come on. Trust me.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.520
Those two are definitely getting together.
I’ll bet my life on it.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.040
(gunfire)

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.680
Whoa!

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.000
What was that?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.280
Sounded like an explosion.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.040
Let’s split up and look.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.920
You two go that way.
I’ll head over here.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.920
Be careful, Prang.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.920
(gunfire)

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.280
(screams)

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.600
Okay.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.600
How did you find me here?

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.640
I mean… I mean…

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.640
You wouldn’t want to kill me, right?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.800
Because if you wanted me dead…
I’d already be dead.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.200
Alright.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.800
Are you two okay?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.320
What the hell is going on, Phe?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.480
What happened?

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.600
Sorry, but I don’t have time to explain right now, okay?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.040
If I get the chance, I’ll explain everything, okay?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.360
(gunfire)

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.560
Pun.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.600
I’ll lead.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.280
We should split up.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.840
He’s after me, not you.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.320
No.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.440
We’re going together.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.960
Let’s go.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.800
Ouch.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.000
Ploy!

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.680
I really shouldn’t have worn heels.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.440
What are you doing?
You’re going to hurt your feet.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.480
Come on.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.240
Don’t lie to me again, okay?

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.440
What?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.080
If we make it out of this,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.680
You have to promise you’ll never lie to me again.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.160
No matter what...

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.000
Same goes for you, Ploy.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.280
No matter how angry you are at me,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.600
don’t go sleeping with anyone else again.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.440
I didn’t sleep with anyone.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.200
Didn’t sleep with anyone?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.240
What about the kiss mark, back then?

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.200
Do you know how many nights
I had nightmares about that?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.560
I dreamed that

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.280
your whole body was covered in
someone else’s marks.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.400
It almost happened, Pun.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.920
But I couldn’t do it.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.600
Because all I could think about was you.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.400
“Almost” isn’t good enough.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.680
I get jealous and a little possessive, you know?

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.760
I don’t like anyone touching you.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.680
Well, if you hadn’t lied to me that day…

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.000
You lied too, Ploy!

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.920
Yeah, but you shouldn’t have started it.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.160
Ugh!

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.120
Are you seriously picking a fight with me now?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.920
I thought we’d already sorted this out.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.560
I’ve been holding it in, Pun.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.040
I was afraid I’d die without saying it.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.880
If you’re afraid you’ll die,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.400
then say something nice before you do.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.920
I love you, Pun.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.360
I love you too, Ploy.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.280
Let’s go.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:24.800
Get in!

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.400
(engine starts)

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.080
Ploy…

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.159
Ploy, I’m scared.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:43.559
It’s alright.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.440
Everything’s going to be okay.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.000
You’re going to be alright, Pun.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.560
I promise.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.280
Hold on tight, okay?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:09.760
(gunfire)

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.280
(gunfire)

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.040
(gunfire)

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:11.680
(gunfire)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.520
(tire screeching)

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.960
He’s still following us.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.680
(siren wailing)

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.240
Put your gun down. Now!

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.240
- ​Clear!
- Hey, someone’s here to help us, Ploy!

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.760
- Move.
- Take them into custody.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.360
We’re safe now.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.000
Hey!

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.440
Ploy?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.280
Ploy. What’s wrong?

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.480
No…

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.760
Ploy. Don’t be like this.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.680
No, I don't want this.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.680
Can you hold my hand?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.960
Don’t let go, okay?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.760
My butterfly.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.200
No.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.920
Ploy. Don’t leave me.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.760
Help!

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.640
Help!

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.800
Help! Someone’s been shot.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.360
“Alert the station. We need an ambulance.”

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.680
Ploy…

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.640
Ploy, please…

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.080
Ploy… Ploy…

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.240
Ploy…

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.560
(2 years later)

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.680
“It’s been two years.”

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.440
“But I still dream about you.”

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.600
“Every moment, good or bad,”

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.000
“comes back to me in my sleep,
never the same dream twice.”

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.000
“But every dream...”

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.360
“is always about Ploy.”

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.760
“Often, I sneak away from the rush of life”

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.840
“to sit here alone,
to take in the tranquility.”

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.400
“I put on my headphones
and listen to the same old songs,”

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.400
“the ones I always play when I miss...”

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.720
“the girl with the nice scent.”

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.960
“And here…”

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.280
“is where I let my thoughts spill freely
onto the canvas.”

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.000
“It would be nice if you were here.”

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.040
“Being alone in the house,”

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.880
“it’s cold.”

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.280
“And lonely.”

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.440
“I miss the warm kitchen…”

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.880
“and the person who would hug me from behind
while we cooked together.”

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.240
“It’s hard to believe”

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.200
“that this much time has passed already.”

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.920
“Over two years of living here”

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.960
“and besides the seasons,”

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.040
“so many other things have changed.”

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.080
(phone ringing)

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.680
Hello?

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.960
Hi, Pun.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.760
I’m not coming home tonight.
I’m staying at my girlfriend’s.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.800
Anne’s letting you stay over now?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.560
Not yet, but…

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.720
tonight’s the night.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.160
And you’re not doing anything today?

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.600
Nope.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.800
I’ve been swamped with work all week.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.680
I just want a full day of sleep.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.920
Sure you won’t end up
overthinking and crying alone?

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.360
You’re one to talk, Phe!

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.640
Crying because your girl
won’t let you in the house.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.080
Take care, okay? Grab something to eat.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.720
Okay.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.800
“Phe’s dating a Thai girl now.”

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.840
“She’s the new chef”

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.280
“who joined the restaurant recently.”

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.680
“As for me,”

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.280
“life in New York has been good.”

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.480
“My career is moving forward.”

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.800
“And I finally have my green card.”

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.760
“Comfortable life, good quality of living.”

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.760
“All that’s left...”

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.080
“is the longing”

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.680
“that never fades.”

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.960
(phone ringing)

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.520
Hello, Dad.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.560
“Hello, Pun. When are you
coming back to Thailand?”

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.800
Hold on. I’ll check for you.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.880
“I rarely go back to Thailand
since moving to New York.”

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.640
“And of course, Dad nags me about it all the time.”

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.360
“Find some time to come home, okay?”

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.280
I'm still upset about it.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.120
About what happened two years ago.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.040
Yes, I know… I know.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.480
I’ll make some time
and come visit you soon, promise.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.520
“Good girl.”

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.720
From now on, tell Mom and Dad everything.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.800
Don’t hide things, big or small.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.920
Yes, sir. Understood, Commander.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.800
I’ll probably go back
around the end of next month.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.640
“Alright. Don’t cancel on us again.”

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.760
“That’s all. Love you.”

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.920
“My family never knew
about the loan or the mafia.”

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.880
“not until Prang found out Ploy was shot.”

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.280
Everything came out.”

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.079
“I got scolded to hell and back.”

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.640
“Even Prang didn’t defend me.”

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.120
“This kind of music”

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.560
“reminds me of when I came here
two years ago.”

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.920
“I sat here alone”

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.000
“until hope showed up again
when I returned home.”

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.440
“But now...”

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.680
“I sit here, alone again.”

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.800
I wish you were here with me.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.520
“Are you thinking about someone?”

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:19.920
Ploy.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.640
"Ploy…"

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.600
“Ploy, don’t leave me. Please.”

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.120
Ploy.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.600
Ploy, don’t leave me.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.560
Ploy.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.080
Pun.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.320
How’s Ploy?

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.640
She’s already in the emergency room.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.920
It’s okay, it’s okay.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.080
It’s alright, Pun.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.120
Ploy will be fine.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.120
Yes, Pun. She’ll be fine.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.280
The doctors here are really good.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.000
Phe, can you sit still?

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.760
Everyone’s stressed right now.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.600
The patient is stable now.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.240
The bullet didn’t hit any vital organs.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.440
But she’ll still need some time to recover.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.480
I’ll take my leave.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
From what you said,
weren’t they all arrested already?

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.840
Some of them managed to escape.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.040
Once their boss was caught,
the members wanted revenge.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.720
But...

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.040
I just didn’t think they’d follow us
all the way to Thailand.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.520
I’m sorry. This is all my fault.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.080
I’m the reason everyone got dragged into this.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.720
(phone vibrating)

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.600
Excuse me.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.120
Hello?

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.240
Ploy.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.920
Prang, Ploy’s awake.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.520
Ploy.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.880
I’ll go get the doctor.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.360
How are you feeling?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.120
Ever since I met you,

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.200
I’ve ended up in the hospital so many times.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.880
Am I your bad luck charm?

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.400
You’re a troublemaker.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.160
Ploy...

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.080
I’m sorry.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.520
For making you get hurt like this.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.880
When I see you right here beside me,

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.400
maybe it was worth it.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.680
Phetai, is your sister awake yet?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.040
“Not yet.”

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040
“All because of you.”

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.960
“Didn’t I tell you to stop behaving like this?”

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.280
“And look how it turned out.”

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.600
“Your sister ended up taking the hit for you.”

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.560
“Keep your voice down. This is a hospital.”

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.920
“Mom… it’s my fault.”

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.640
I’m sorry. I really am.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.520
Sorry?

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.760
You’re saying sorry, does that stop your sister’s pain?

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.440
And what if something worse had happened to her?

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.400
How would I live with that?

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.760
“I can’t lose another child, not again.”

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.000
“It’s alright, love.”

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.200
She’s safe now.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.360
It’s alright. She’s safe.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.000
And what if she ends up scarred?

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.320
How will you make it right?

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.480
Mom.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.360
Plastic surgeons these days are really skilled.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.360
Their work is flawless.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.000
At worst she’ll have, like…

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.480
a tiny little scar. Barely noticeable.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.760
How are you so chill about this?

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.160
It’s your sister’s life.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.640
Your own sister’s life!

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.480
And you think I don’t know that?

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.960
You think I don’t feel guilty?

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.080
“I know all of this is my fault, Mom.”

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.480
“You think I’m standing here chilled?”

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.400
“You think what I said just now
means I’m not worried about her?”

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.400
“You think you and Dad are
the only ones who care?”

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.200
I know it’s my fault.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.440
All of this is on me.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.760
What more do you want, Mom?
I’m already trying my best.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.600
- But what you did before that…
- That’s enough.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.160
Enough from both of you.
Go on. Go visit your sister.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.840
Go, go. You too.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.760
Calm down.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.000
You’re awake?

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.400
Here.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.720
Chicken Pad Krapow, not spicy.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.480
Yours.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.840
Does it hurt?

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.160
I’m sorry.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.960
It hurts so much, Mom.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.680
It’s alright now.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.120
Mom’s here now.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.160
Have some water.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.960
Let me help you.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.200
Thank you.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.880
The doctor said…

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.960
you need to stay in the hospital
for another week.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.160
Oh? And you…?

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.080
I’ve already taken leave from work.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.240
I took the whole month off.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.280
So I can be here for Prang’s wedding too.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.320
Isn’t that still months away?

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.080
Oh, that…

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.120
They moved it up.
It’ll just be a small family ceremony.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.800
Right?

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.960
Honey, tell Ploy.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.800
What? Why don’t you say it yourself?

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.880
I’m too shy.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.120
Shy about what?

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.680
Just tell her.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.080
Look at the ring.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.080
“After facing danger,”

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.800
“and seeing my friend
nearly die in front of me.”

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.720
I realized how unpredictable life is.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.600
And once I understood my own heart,

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.760
I don’t want to waste even a single second.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.240
I want to spend all the time I have left

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.720
with the person I love.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.000
And I promise
I’ll do everything to make you happy.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.600
Throughout the time we’ve been together,

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.720
it has made me realize

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.240
that no matter how different we are…

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.360
no matter when we disagree...

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.600
or whatever problems we face…

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.040
just looking into your eyes,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.120
I feel safe.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.800
Just holding hands like this.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.840
It makes me believe

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.800
that we can overcome anything together.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.560
I feel so, so lucky

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.320
to have you in my life.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.600
Thank you so much, Prang.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.320
Ahem.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.560
As your dear friend and family,

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.840
I hereby pronounce you both

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.680
married,

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.560
partners for life.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.560
May you always be happy.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.320
Yay!

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.600
Kiss!

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.640
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.960
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.840
♫ You’re my Love Game ♫

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.440
♫ Only you can make me feel the same ♫
- Yay!

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.240
♫ Don’t you know my heart’s gone wild inside? ♫

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.200
♫ All I want is you here by my side ♫

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.680
- ♫ Forever, is that fine? ♫
- We’re married!

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.960
You’re heading back tomorrow, right?

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.240
I’m sorry.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.760
I haven't really spent much time with you.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.640
What do you mean?

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.920
You’ve been taking care of me for days.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.840
That counts as spending time together already.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.040
Pun.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:44.200
Hm?

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.400
What about us?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.960
I actually wanted to talk to you
about that too.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.520
I don’t think I’d be very okay,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.560
being the woman having an affair
with my own sister-in-law.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.600
So here’s the thing, Ploy

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.120
I’ve made my decision.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.720
I’m not moving back to Thailand.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.080
It might sound selfish,

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.360
but…

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.240
my life in New York is my dream.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.560
I once gave up everything to be with you.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.120
But when you were gone,

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.040
I had nothing left.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.040
And I don’t want you, Ploy,

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.360
to give up everything to come live with me.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.640
Do you want us

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.600
to be long-distance or something?

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.560
Yes.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.320
But I really believe

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.760
our love is strong enough.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.800
We’ll find a way through it.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.440
What do you think, Ploy?

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.080
“After that, we lived
across the world for two years.”

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.040
“I missed you terribly.”

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.960
I missed you terribly too.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.440
“At first it seemed okay.”

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.200
“We still talked often.”

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.080
Love you.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.640
“But it was only through a tiny screen.”

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.440
“Oh, I have to go now.”

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.640
You’re leaving already?

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.800
“Bye-bye.”

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.120
Bye-bye.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:12.199
“What’s worse”

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.560
“is that our free time stopped lining up,”

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.480
“because of the ten-hour time difference.”

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.400
“I tried to make time to fly over to see her.”

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.280
“And even though seeing her made me happy,”

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:41.880
“Every time I came back, a scandal followed me home.”

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.639
(”Actress with initial P spotted in the US.
Rumoured to be rising toward lead-role status.”)

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.040
“Being exhausted then coming home
with no one to hold.”

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.880
“Missing someone…”

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.800
“but being unable to do anything about it.”

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.240
“(sighs) I think…”

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.560
“Each day, it’s getting harder for me.”

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.680
Hey, we haven’t talked in so long.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.280
Don’t you want to start with something nice, Ploy?

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.440
“I just want you to know how I feel.”

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.240
I do know.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.680
But when we finally get to talk,

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.960
I want that to be
the happiest moment for us.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.680
“we’re not going to talk about our problems at all?”

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.560
“If I’m tired, ”

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.280
“do I just have to keep it inside?”

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.560
Do you think you’re the only one struggling?

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.640
I’m hurting too.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.040
Every time I want to call you,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.280
I can’t because you’re working.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.520
I’ve been eating alone for so long.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.240
I don’t like it either.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.920
And do you think I’m okay

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.200
with you not visiting me for months at a time?

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.000
“Yes.”

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.360
“I know you must be tired too.”

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.320
“That’s why I think”

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.400
“long-distance just isn’t working anymore.”

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.480
Ploy…?

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.160
Ploy, what do you mean?

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.720
“I think”

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.040
“we should end things here.”

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.440
Ploy, do you mean

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.920
our relationship ends just like that?

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.800
“You didn’t even let me finish before crying?”

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.000
Such a crybaby.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.160
Ploy…

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.600
There, there.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.000
Don’t cry.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.880
Hey, how did you get here?

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.280
Why didn’t you tell me?
I would’ve picked you up.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.440
And what was that 'ending things' about?

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.480
I don’t want that. I’m not ending anything.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.160
There, there, Pun.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.560
Are you hungry?

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.080
Let’s go get something to eat.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.480
Huh?

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.480
Come here. There, there.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.480
Alright, alright. I won’t tease you anymore.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.840
I’m really happy you came to see me.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.680
But…

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.080
aren’t you going to explain anything?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.840
I was planning to surprise you.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.920
So...

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.160
what you said earlier was just teasing?

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.760
No.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.360
I meant every word.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.640
Then...

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.840
does that mean you’re breaking up with me?

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.080
Are you?

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.240
No.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:21.600
What?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.480
I’m so confused.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.920
Try a bite first.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.680
Then I’ll tell you.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.120
How does it taste?

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.160
It’s good.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:53.960
And...

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.960
what do you think of this restaurant?

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.680
Mhm.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.040
It’s nice. I like it.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.640
I remember walking past here often before.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.640
But it looks familiar.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.280
I don’t think it looked like this back then.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320
Mhm.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.440
And...

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.440
do you see that wall over there?

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.600
Don’t you think it looks a bit too empty?

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360
It does look empty, yes.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.560
But why? It has nothing to do with us.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.680
I was thinking…

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.200
of asking you to help decorate it.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.240
- Pun.
- Mm-hmm.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.160
- This restaurant…
- Mm-hmm.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.480
Do you know the owner, Ploy?

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.200
You’re talking to the owner right now.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.320
This restaurant is ours.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.560
Ji.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.040
I have something to talk to you.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.320
Yes?

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.800
If I move to New York,

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.360
what do you think about that?

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.720
Are you sure, Ploy?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:48.600
Yes.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.440
Then go.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.040
If that’s what you want,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.920
no one can stop you.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.720
And your happiness

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.560
is over there.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.720
So it’s right for you to go.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:13.760
Isn’t it?

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.240
I can really go, right?

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.320
Yes, you really can.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.480
“I’ve been taking fewer jobs since last year.”

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.240
“As for the shoe brand,
I handed it over to Min to manage.”

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.280
“And every time I flew to see you,”

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.760
“I secretly kept looking for a place.”

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.560
I think this location is great.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.600
The owner’s moving back to Thailand,
so they sold it.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.080
I think it’s better than starting from scratch.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.480
Why aren’t you in bed yet?

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:41.800
- I’m going to.
- Hm?

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.720
I asked Ploy, not you.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.440
Fine…

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.080
Phe was chatting with me for fun.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.840
- I’m going to bed.
- Let’s go to bed.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.480
Good night, brother.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.080
Mm.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:56.960
Bye-bye.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.160
Are you saying
you’re moving here?

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.040
Well, since you won’t come back to Thailand,

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.440
I figured I’d move here instead. Problem solved.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.520
But…

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.880
I don’t want you to give everything up because of me.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.240
I don’t want to hold you back.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.320
I’m not giving anything up.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.320
I’m just done.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:38.520
And ready to start over.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.800
I don’t need anything else in my life,
except you.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.880
My dream

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.960
is simply to be with you.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.040
I only want you.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.000
“Many times, life feels like walking
a long, dark road.”

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.880
“It makes us afraid.”

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.760
“Afraid of taking the wrong step.”

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.400
“Afraid of falling.”

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.200
“Because we think we’re walking it alone.”

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.120
“And the shadows around us”

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.760
- “feel empty.”
- (“How are you doing?”)

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.680
“In the end, that fear
keeps us from moving forward.”

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.040
“But what if”

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.880
“in those shadows,”

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.000
“there’s someone else walking too?”

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.440
“Walking alongside us.”

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.400
“Seeing us.”

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.120
“Or maybe”

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.200
“to keep walking through life…”

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.520
“all we really need is to believe.”

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.960
“Believe that someone
will stand by us sincerely.”

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.280
“And that we deserve that sincerity.”

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.760
“Believe that we’re allowed to make mistakes.”

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.520
“Allowed to fall.”

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.040
“Because there will always be someone,”

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.600
“who reaches out and catches us.”

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:18.840
Again?
