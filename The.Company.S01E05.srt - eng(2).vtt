00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.240
(Adapted from Xuan Se's novel
of the same title.)

=Episode 5=

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.560
Once you start scrolling,
you can't stop.

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:52.680
(Top influencer Nana has recently been
revealed to have a new relationship.)

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.777
(So, she has been taken.)

00:01:53.777 --> 00:01:54.600
Isn't that Lu Feng?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.510
(This lucky man)

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.480
(is an artist named Lu Feng.)

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.480
(The two were photographed dining
together at a high-end restaurant.)

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.070
Wasn't that just now?

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.070
These paparazzi work fast.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.640
(Lu Feng's sculpture exhibition
opens tomorrow.)

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:10.422
(He's really holding
an exhibition tomorrow.)

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.580
(Lu Feng)

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.530
Feng, the video
you had the paparazzi take

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.960
has hit a million views.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.630
Did you settle the remaining payment?

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.244
I did. The non-disclosure agreement
has also been confirmed.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400
These paparazzi

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.120
charge a hefty sum.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.800
They really think they're something.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.710
As long as there's popularity,

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.080
everything's negotiable.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.360
Feng,

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.080
you look pale.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.520
Are you okay?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.470
Same old problem.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.240
Stomach pain.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.750
You haven't eaten all day.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.150
Want me to order porridge for you?

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.990
No need.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.800
You head back first.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.920
Oh, right.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.360
The guy you added on WeChat just now...

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.511
Do you want to contact him?

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.590
Who?

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.190
The one outside the restaurant.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.030
His surname is Su.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.000
Ignore him.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.080
Zhang.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.000
Buy me some stomach medicine.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.120
The liquor cabinet is empty, too.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.030
Bring back two bottles of wine.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.870
Okay.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.260
(Huayang Media, Shiyan:
See you tomorrow, Feng.)

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.700
(Planner Bai: Thanks for the invite,
Feng. See you tomorrow.)

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.860
(Publicity Ruby: Coming to see
the big star tomorrow.)

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.700
(See you tomorrow.)

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.190
(Lu Feng)
It's all scandals about him.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.360
Lu Feng used to be so sincere

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.310
and devoted.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.960
Now he's turned into a playboy.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.840
He let Lan down at Tianguang Market.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.080
Fame and fortune

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.080
are an artist's greatest enemies.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.120
His passion

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.750
has probably faded long ago.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.750
Bizhi.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.520
What are we

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.080
looking for

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.680
this time?

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.680
Kunwu Blade.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.430
It consists of
the Kun Blade and the Wu Blade.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.680
We're after Lu Feng's Wu Blade
this time.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.510
There's no news about the other one.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.750
What do we do now?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.860
(Lu Feng)

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480
I knew you'd have a plan.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.933
You said we were just looking around.

00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:36.480
Why do you only have one ticket?

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.470
Where's mine?

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.000
I didn't buy one for you.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.830
I'll buy it myself.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.830
Phones are really convenient.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.177
You can buy anything with them.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.420
(Invitation)

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.800
E-ticket.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.000
Eco-friendly.

00:04:54.288 --> 00:04:56.750
Are you planning to go to
an art exhibition dressed like that?

00:04:58.682 --> 00:04:59.630
What's wrong with this?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.520
Bizhi.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.070
How do I look?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.680
Presentable, right?

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.630
I think it looks pretty good.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.560
I've never worn clothes like this.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.950
They're so expensive.

00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:25.390
Do we really have to buy them?

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.630
I already did.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.710
Let's go.

00:05:30.711 --> 00:05:31.830
I didn't take off the tags.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.800
Can I return them later?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.640
Yes.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.510
Bizhi.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.350
Have a nice day.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.190
I look like a successful guy now.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.630
I can fool Lu Feng, right?

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:42.555
(Custom Tailoring)
Just don't talk.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.790
You!

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.440
Mr. Lu,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.390
your current style

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.390
is very different from your early work.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.000
Did you experience a change in life,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.430
or did you compromise with the market?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.040
François Millet once said

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.630
we should view ordinary things
with a noble heart

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.630
to give art its true power.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.190
The issues of this world
are very complex.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.680
I try to tell them

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.830
in a surreal way

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.733
and avoid rigid traditional thinking

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.480
without putting myself
in direct opposition.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.510
Yes, you're right.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.390
You applied to the national art academy
at twenty,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.000
and it took you five years to get in.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.600
What kept you going

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.800
during those five years?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.240
Is five years really that long?

00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:30.571
I think

00:06:30.571 --> 00:06:33.651
time only adds to our anxiety.

00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:37.091
It creates a sense of
fleeting emptiness.

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:40.241
So I turn those distractions

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.921
into images of life.

00:06:44.311 --> 00:06:45.209
Thank you.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.320
That concludes my interview.

00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:47.381
Alright, let's wrap it up.

00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:50.651
You're Xuan, right?

00:06:50.688 --> 00:06:52.010
Let's add each other on WeChat.

00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:52.851
Sure.

00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:54.771
It's done.

00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:55.971
If anything comes up,

00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:57.481
you can contact me directly,

00:06:57.891 --> 00:06:58.731
alright?

00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:00.241
Feng.

00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:03.171
Ms. Kaihua.

00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:04.571
Big star.

00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:07.531
I just got off the plane
and rushed over.

00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:09.131
I was waiting for you.

00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:10.211
I know.

00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:11.361
You said you'd bring clients.

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:12.601
Don't forget.

00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:13.891
Don't worry.

00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:17.571
All your works are flawless.

00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:20.481
I just bought a villa in the suburbs.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.888
There's space on the second floor.

00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:24.010
It's perfect for displaying your pieces.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.088
That'd be my honor.

00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:27.970
I'll personally pick some for you later.

00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:28.811
Sure.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.090
(Nana)
(Give me an explanation in three days.)

00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:33.891
(Either we go public, or we're done.)

00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:41.011
Ms. Kaihua, come.

00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:43.041
This is my latest work.

00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:43.891
Mr. Lu.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.280
A client is waiting for you
in the tea room.

00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.131
They'd like to meet you.

00:07:47.131 --> 00:07:48.041
I'm busy right now.

00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:50.241
They're a major client.

00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:51.841
They bought several pieces,

00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:53.481
including that one.

00:07:57.011 --> 00:07:58.131
I'm so sorry.

00:07:58.281 --> 00:07:59.331
The exhibition is really...

00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:03.201
You two?

00:08:03.601 --> 00:08:04.971
Mr. Lu, you're really busy,

00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:06.281
yet you still remember us.

00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:07.361
Impressive.

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.201
Please have a seat.

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.891
I wanted to contact this...

00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:11.921
Su.

00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:13.331
Mr. Su.

00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:15.331
But you know how hectic

00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:16.451
an exhibition can be.

00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:17.651
I haven't slept all night.

00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:18.841
I understand.

00:08:18.841 --> 00:08:20.531
You're an experienced collector.

00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:21.771
You must've run

00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:23.691
a gallery before, right?

00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:25.161
I wonder which one it is.

00:08:25.531 --> 00:08:26.371
Rain Manor.

00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:28.891
Rain Manor?

00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:32.291
That estate is known for collecting
rare treasures from all over?

00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:34.521
I knew Mr. Yu, the owner.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.001
I suppose he passed away long ago.

00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:41.291
My great-grandfather
was a close friend of his.

00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:42.641
To be precise,

00:08:43.211 --> 00:08:44.481
my great-grandfather

00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:47.001
funded him.

00:09:01.121 --> 00:09:02.291
I was too blind

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:03.571
not to recognize you.

00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:05.241
I slighted you yesterday.

00:09:05.241 --> 00:09:07.291
I'm not usually high-profile.

00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:09.521
It's just that my young friend here

00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:12.121
admires your work greatly,

00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:13.521
so he seemed showy.

00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:16.601
Please forgive us.
We're simply too eager to buy your work.

00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:17.601
Not at all.

00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:18.931
- This Mr...
- Su.

00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:20.241
Mr. Su,

00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:21.641
a pleasure to meet you.

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:23.211
You sure change your tune fast.

00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:27.131
By the way,

00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:30.361
our boss wants to buy
one more item from you.

00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:32.411
Of course.

00:09:33.411 --> 00:09:35.451
But most of the works on display today

00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:37.601
have been sold.

00:09:37.601 --> 00:09:39.481
There are some pieces not yet exhibited.

00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:40.321
Zhang,

00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:41.971
bring me my catalogue.

00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:42.951
- Yes.
- Quick.

00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:48.571
Please have a look.

00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:51.641
Some pieces are quite remarkable.

00:09:51.641 --> 00:09:54.121
A lady just bought four at once.

00:09:54.291 --> 00:09:56.121
She said she'd place one

00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:57.721
on each floor of her villa.

00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.171
Really?

00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:02.121
Mr. Lu, you're indeed
an outstanding artist.

00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:03.451
Impressive.

00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:05.091
I only want one thing.

00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:06.841
A dagger.

00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:09.571
Dagger?

00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:11.291
I heard you're in possession of
the Wu Blade.

00:10:11.291 --> 00:10:12.171
To be honest,

00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:15.331
it belonged to
a deceased friend of mine.

00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:16.931
If you sell it to me,

00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:18.931
everything else is negotiable.

00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:27.931
Wu Blade?

00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:30.051
Are you reluctant to give it away,

00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:32.361
or have you forgotten?

00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:35.241
I believe I have one.

00:10:35.241 --> 00:10:37.251
But my storage holds

00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:38.121
many items.

00:10:38.121 --> 00:10:40.121
Please give me some time

00:10:40.331 --> 00:10:41.479
to look for it.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.111
Take the catalogue with you.

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:44.720
Look it over when you have time.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.222
I have other matters to attend to.

00:10:46.244 --> 00:10:47.450
I need to go.

00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:48.291
Yes, go ahead.

00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:49.721
Feel free to read it.

00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:50.561
Please excuse me.

00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:56.091
Money really does
make the world go around.

00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:58.171
Did you see how fast his tune changed?

00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:01.571
But was your great-grandfather

00:11:01.571 --> 00:11:03.521
an investor in Rain Manor?

00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:05.481
No.

00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:08.571
You were lying?

00:11:10.521 --> 00:11:11.481
I didn't lie.

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:13.881
I was an acquaintance of Mr. Yu.

00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:35.521
Wu Blade?

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:38.001
I don't remember that at all.

00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:46.831
(Nana: How are we responding
to the trending topic?)

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.591
(Sorry, I'm busy today.)

00:13:34.521 --> 00:13:35.641
Next, let's welcome

00:13:35.641 --> 00:13:38.601
young artist Lu Feng to the stage.

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:40.351
(Rising Art Awards of Huayang City)

00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:48.911
(Rising Art Award, Lu Feng)

00:14:38.091 --> 00:14:38.931
Sir,

00:14:39.361 --> 00:14:40.481
please have a look.

00:14:41.001 --> 00:14:42.451
Is this the one?

00:14:51.121 --> 00:14:52.171
I believe

00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:53.971
you can carve

00:14:54.241 --> 00:14:56.121
your finest work with it.

00:14:56.881 --> 00:14:59.241
(Isn't this the blade Lan gave him?)

00:15:04.331 --> 00:15:05.291
Name your price.

00:15:06.971 --> 00:15:07.761
Sir,

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:09.171
you've supported me so much.

00:15:09.641 --> 00:15:10.761
This Wu Blade

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:12.241
isn't worth much.

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:13.291
It's not valuable.

00:15:13.721 --> 00:15:15.331
Consider it a gift.

00:15:15.601 --> 00:15:17.211
Let's be friends.

00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:21.971
I'll pay for the sculptures now.

00:15:22.641 --> 00:15:23.481
Sir,

00:15:24.241 --> 00:15:25.641
when I hold my next exhibition,

00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:27.971
I hope you'll honor me
with your presence.

00:15:28.488 --> 00:15:29.840
As for the Rain Manor Art Gallery

00:15:30.331 --> 00:15:31.451
you mentioned,

00:15:31.691 --> 00:15:34.171
I also hope you can introduce me.

00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:37.811
If my work could be exhibited
at Rain Manor,

00:15:37.811 --> 00:15:39.971
it would be the greatest honor
of my life.

00:15:40.641 --> 00:15:43.121
I hope you'll focus on creating

00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:44.511
and keep distractions at bay.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:46.931
Sir, this way, please.

00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:49.091
How would you like to pay?

00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:49.931
Cash.

00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:52.930
Come with me to withdraw it.

00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:53.851
Yes, sure.

00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:58.091
Your boss really is

00:15:58.091 --> 00:15:59.091
quite a character.

00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:01.201
Su,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.760
there's a great restaurant nearby.

00:16:02.931 --> 00:16:05.521
I'll treat both of you
to dinner tonight.

00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:07.571
I'll invite Nana as well.

00:16:07.571 --> 00:16:08.601
You know her, right?

00:16:08.761 --> 00:16:11.171
The influencer
with twenty million followers.

00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:12.121
She can really sing.

00:16:13.121 --> 00:16:15.361
Is Miss Nana your girlfriend?

00:16:24.361 --> 00:16:26.211
I'm really disappointed in you, Lu Feng.

00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:30.480
You lost your memories after
leaving Tianguang Market, that's fine.

00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:32.481
You forget something, that's fine.

00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:34.171
But how did your character

00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:35.971
and your morals change, too?

00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:38.761
Do you even see what you've become?

00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:40.121
Snobbish.

00:16:40.121 --> 00:16:41.051
Greedy.

00:16:41.051 --> 00:16:42.601
A total playboy.

00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:44.331
Do you think this is fair to Lan?

00:16:46.691 --> 00:16:47.531
Lan?

00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:49.011
Never mind.

00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:52.811
You don't deserve Lan.

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:55.444
And you don't deserve
that Wu blade either.

00:16:56.241 --> 00:16:57.081
Sir.

00:17:05.231 --> 00:17:07.871
(Yashe)

00:17:13.561 --> 00:17:15.651
You actually bought them?

00:17:16.155 --> 00:17:17.210
What else could I do?

00:17:17.561 --> 00:17:18.401
So,

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.281
what now?

00:17:21.611 --> 00:17:22.451
We'll see.

00:17:24.751 --> 00:17:27.791
(Frank and Upright)

00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:31.001
Does money corrupt people?

00:17:31.241 --> 00:17:32.721
It's not money that corrupts him.

00:17:32.866 --> 00:17:34.890
It's because
he forgets his original intention.

00:17:35.311 --> 00:17:38.244
That's why he drifted farther
and farther away from who he used to be.

00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.931
He's someone irrelevant.

00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:43.561
Why do you care so much about him?

00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:46.411
Maybe because

00:17:46.931 --> 00:17:49.411
more than ten years
have passed in real life.

00:17:49.971 --> 00:17:51.281
But for me,

00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:55.481
everything that happened in
Tianguang Market feels like yesterday.

00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:57.721
He used to be so sincere,

00:17:58.281 --> 00:18:00.131
and now he's turned into a jerk.

00:18:00.891 --> 00:18:02.241
I can't accept it.

00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:05.651
Time travel can stir up emotions
like that.

00:18:05.933 --> 00:18:07.080
But you must remember this.

00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:09.521
We can't change their life paths.

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:11.850
And we shouldn't form emotional ties
with them either.

00:18:14.481 --> 00:18:15.241
The piece here

00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:17.411
is one of the key works

00:18:17.411 --> 00:18:18.481
in my exhibition.

00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:20.801
I want to show

00:18:21.371 --> 00:18:24.171
a sense of realism and eeriness.

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.011
Feng.

00:18:26.321 --> 00:18:26.849
Ms. Kaihua.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.044
The interview isn't over yet.

00:18:28.088 --> 00:18:29.000
Why is he like this?

00:18:29.481 --> 00:18:29.891
Come.

00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:30.761
Let me introduce you.

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:33.321
This is Dean Wu
from the Fine Arts Academy.

00:18:34.411 --> 00:18:35.651
Hello, Dean Wu.

00:18:35.651 --> 00:18:36.971
You're truly young and talented.

00:18:37.131 --> 00:18:37.931
Thank you.

00:18:37.931 --> 00:18:39.971
This is an investor, Mr. Tao.

00:18:40.044 --> 00:18:41.170
Mr. Tao. We know each other.

00:18:41.171 --> 00:18:42.691
We have each other's contact.
In the flesh, finally.

00:18:42.691 --> 00:18:43.481
You're impressive.

00:18:43.481 --> 00:18:44.321
Thank you.

00:18:44.481 --> 00:18:46.801
Let me introduce

00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:48.129
my new works to everyone today.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.400
Alright. Let's take a look.

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:52.031
(Nana calling)

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:54.040
- Come.
- So beautiful.

00:18:54.041 --> 00:18:57.041
This is very different

00:18:57.041 --> 00:18:58.801
from my usual work.

00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:03.081
- From its height to the materials.
- Isn't that Lu Feng?

00:19:03.081 --> 00:19:05.371
- We can see the overall style
- That's him, right?

00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:06.281
is...

00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:07.761
Check your phone.

00:19:07.761 --> 00:19:08.721
Lu Feng is trending.

00:19:08.891 --> 00:19:10.521
Besides, it makes everyone...

00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:15.361
What's wrong, Ms. Kaihua?

00:19:21.918 --> 00:19:23.671
(Trending Topic)

00:19:26.321 --> 00:19:27.161
Ms. Kaihua,

00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:29.561
about this...

00:19:29.561 --> 00:19:30.971
Quick. Interview him.

00:19:30.971 --> 00:19:32.211
- He's right there.
- Sir.

00:19:32.211 --> 00:19:34.521
Mr. Lu Feng, could you respond

00:19:34.521 --> 00:19:35.691
to the news?

00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:36.761
Can you explain it?

00:19:36.761 --> 00:19:37.721
Mr. Lu Feng,

00:19:38.081 --> 00:19:39.131
could you explain this?

00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:41.371
Was this a publicity stunt
from the agency?

00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:42.831
Did you know about this beforehand?

00:19:43.371 --> 00:19:44.211
Ms. Kaihua.

00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:46.761
Please respond directly.

00:20:00.851 --> 00:20:03.321
(Well, this famous artist, Lu.)

00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:05.281
(Before the night of his exhibition...)

00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:06.891
Oh no.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.488
(He happened to have dinner with Nana)

00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:10.040
(and happened to get photographed
by paparazzi.)

00:20:10.041 --> 00:20:12.411
Your sculptures
won't be able to sell now.

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:14.561
(How do so many things
coincidentally line up?)

00:20:15.411 --> 00:20:17.371
Do these bloggers ever sleep?

00:20:17.371 --> 00:20:18.651
(Another woman has come forward)

00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:22.131
(and claimed that while dating Lu,)

00:20:22.131 --> 00:20:23.761
(he constantly asked her)

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.266
(to use her PR position
to arrange interviews)

00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:28.690
(and magazine features for him.)

00:20:28.691 --> 00:20:30.281
(She later found out)

00:20:30.355 --> 00:20:32.200
(that when he said
he was on a business trip,)

00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:33.131
(he was actually)

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:36.041
(traveling with a female CEO
from a major corporation.)

00:20:36.041 --> 00:20:37.241
(Oh, heavens.)

00:20:37.288 --> 00:20:39.555
(This kind of shamelessness
is on another level.)

00:20:49.791 --> 00:20:51.429
(Nana, I miss you.
Please reply. I'm having a hard time.)

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.266
(I'm sorry, Nana.)

00:20:52.266 --> 00:20:53.820
(Nana has enabled friend verification.
You're no longer her friend.)

00:20:58.551 --> 00:20:59.671
(Ms. Kaihua)

00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:05.141
Hello?

00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:06.771
Ms. Kaihua,

00:21:06.931 --> 00:21:07.771
I...

00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:23.101
Lu Feng?

00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:24.891
Is that Lu Feng?

00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:28.121
Lu Feng's here!

00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:29.531
It's him! Take the picture!

00:21:29.531 --> 00:21:30.371
Expose him!

00:21:57.888 --> 00:21:59.466
(Fried Rice Noodles,
Fried Noodles, Fried Rice)

00:21:59.466 --> 00:22:01.080
Young man, how much did you drink?

00:22:01.851 --> 00:22:03.081
Grab a bite before you go.

00:22:12.001 --> 00:22:13.371
One fried rice with egg, please.

00:22:13.371 --> 00:22:14.211
Sure thing.

00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:25.560
Here's your fried rice.

00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:27.011
The soup's free.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.060
(Year 2009)

00:24:17.131 --> 00:24:17.971
Give me more.

00:24:18.291 --> 00:24:19.131
Sure.

00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:20.761
Lan, your fried rice is the best.

00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:22.129
Here, a spoon. Enjoy.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.577
I'll come again next time, Lan.

00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:34.251
Excuse me.

00:24:34.481 --> 00:24:35.721
Where is this place?

00:24:37.171 --> 00:24:38.011
You just got here?

00:24:39.066 --> 00:24:40.610
This place is called Tianguang Market.

00:24:40.801 --> 00:24:42.891
Just think of it as a hidden paradise.

00:24:44.131 --> 00:24:45.891
Tianguang Market?

00:24:46.761 --> 00:24:49.281
How do I get out?

00:24:50.321 --> 00:24:51.171
You can't.

00:24:51.521 --> 00:24:52.451
Why not?

00:24:53.971 --> 00:24:54.971
You've seen it yourself.

00:24:54.977 --> 00:24:57.466
People from different dynasties
wander in here all the time.

00:24:57.561 --> 00:24:59.041
It's easy to enter, but hard to leave.

00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:00.411
Not just you,

00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:02.081
even I don't know
when I'll be able to go.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.520
What am I supposed to do?

00:25:08.171 --> 00:25:10.521
Did you come here through thick fog?

00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:12.651
They say when the fog appears,

00:25:12.971 --> 00:25:13.891
some people enter,

00:25:13.891 --> 00:25:15.001
and some can leave.

00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:16.041
You can try your luck.

00:25:19.001 --> 00:25:19.891
Where's the fog?

00:25:20.131 --> 00:25:20.969
Go straight ahead.

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.390
There's a river called
the River of Oblivion. Go take a look.

00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:26.051
Thank you.

00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:39.881
Stop.

00:25:40.177 --> 00:25:41.488
Please let me get on the raft.

00:25:41.521 --> 00:25:42.211
Someone told me

00:25:42.211 --> 00:25:43.721
that if I enter the fog, I can leave.

00:25:43.721 --> 00:25:44.561
Please let me pass.

00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:46.131
When the fog rises,

00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:47.851
someone will leave.

00:25:47.851 --> 00:25:49.851
But you're not that person.

00:25:50.131 --> 00:25:51.211
Why not me?

00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:53.561
That choice isn't yours.

00:25:53.691 --> 00:25:54.531
I don't believe you.

00:25:55.211 --> 00:25:56.481
Take me into the fog.

00:25:56.691 --> 00:26:00.481
Only the guests of Luoxia Manor
can use the raft.

00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:03.081
Hold up.

00:26:03.521 --> 00:26:05.211
The water is hundreds of meters deep.

00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:06.761
You could lose your life.

00:26:07.281 --> 00:26:08.721
You should leave.

00:26:23.891 --> 00:26:24.731
You're back.

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:27.691
Are you hungry?

00:26:43.721 --> 00:26:45.051
Here, eat while it's hot.

00:26:46.155 --> 00:26:47.290
Do you want some chili?

00:26:47.601 --> 00:26:48.451
No chili.

00:26:48.451 --> 00:26:49.971
- Scallions?
- No.

00:26:57.891 --> 00:26:58.731
I...

00:26:59.321 --> 00:27:00.171
don't have any money.

00:27:00.761 --> 00:27:01.611
That's fine.

00:27:01.611 --> 00:27:02.931
We don't use money here.

00:27:02.931 --> 00:27:03.891
We trade goods.

00:27:10.851 --> 00:27:11.691
What is this?

00:27:11.691 --> 00:27:13.001
I'm a student.

00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:14.321
These are the only things

00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:15.691
I have.

00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:16.760
You can pay it back later.

00:27:17.211 --> 00:27:19.039
You won't be leaving
anytime soon anyway.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.333
You can pay it back slowly.

00:27:20.561 --> 00:27:21.401
Thank you.

00:27:34.761 --> 00:27:36.211
Eat slowly.

00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:54.691
How long

00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:55.971
have you been here?

00:27:57.451 --> 00:27:59.481
There's no day or night here.

00:27:59.481 --> 00:28:00.561
I've lost track of time.

00:28:01.611 --> 00:28:02.851
Aren't you anxious?

00:28:03.622 --> 00:28:05.560
I need to go back
and prepare for the exam.

00:28:05.891 --> 00:28:08.281
If I miss it,
I'll have to wait another year.

00:28:08.688 --> 00:28:09.890
It's no use being anxious.

00:28:10.281 --> 00:28:13.081
You should think about how
to make a living in Tianguang Market.

00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:15.931
Making a living?

00:28:17.171 --> 00:28:18.451
I'm just a student.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.080
How am I supposed to do that?

00:28:24.131 --> 00:28:24.971
Are you alright?

00:28:25.611 --> 00:28:26.481
I'm fine.

00:28:26.891 --> 00:28:27.999
This cleaver isn't sturdy.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.355
The handle keeps falling off.

00:28:30.851 --> 00:28:31.931
Can I take a look?

00:28:41.281 --> 00:28:42.521
The joint doesn't fit.

00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:43.930
Do you have a small knife?

00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:44.771
A small knife?

00:28:49.281 --> 00:28:50.121
Can this work?

00:28:52.241 --> 00:28:53.081
Yes.

00:29:05.241 --> 00:29:06.611
This dagger is pretty good.

00:29:07.131 --> 00:29:07.971
Of course.

00:29:08.044 --> 00:29:10.450
This Kunwu Blade is a family heirloom
from my mother's side.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:11.644
It's forged from Xuan iron.

00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:13.481
It stays sharp without sharpening.

00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:14.491
It's amazing, right?

00:29:17.009 --> 00:29:18.191
- Done.
- Done?

00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:22.411
I didn't expect

00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:23.451
you to be a carpenter.

00:29:24.611 --> 00:29:25.891
I'm majoring

00:29:26.211 --> 00:29:28.321
in sculpture,
that's what we call it where I'm from.

00:29:28.321 --> 00:29:29.161
Sculpture?

00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:30.851
What's that?

00:29:36.281 --> 00:29:36.889
Well...

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:37.977
There's this wooden figure.

00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:41.131
You cover it with clay.

00:29:41.481 --> 00:29:42.521
After that,

00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:44.241
carve it into a finished piece

00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:47.081
with a knife.

00:29:49.281 --> 00:29:50.121
How about this?

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:51.422
Do you have paper and a brush?

00:29:51.831 --> 00:29:52.691
Yes.

00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:53.531
I need them.

00:29:54.971 --> 00:29:56.131
Will this do?

00:29:56.691 --> 00:29:57.531
Let me see.

00:29:58.241 --> 00:29:59.081
Yes.

00:30:19.931 --> 00:30:20.771
Good.

00:30:22.851 --> 00:30:23.691
What's this?

00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:24.731
This is you.

00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:26.561
- Me?
- Yes.

00:30:26.561 --> 00:30:28.171
I've never seen a drawing

00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:29.651
like this.

00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:31.001
In our world,

00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:33.211
art focuses on perspective,
three-dimensionality,

00:30:33.411 --> 00:30:34.451
and light and shadow.

00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:36.721
Perspective and three dimensions?

00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:39.411
But...

00:30:39.801 --> 00:30:42.651
I'm not very talented.

00:30:42.888 --> 00:30:43.970
I don't draw that well.

00:30:44.721 --> 00:30:45.691
You draw very well.

00:30:46.155 --> 00:30:47.410
And you're good with your hands.

00:30:48.081 --> 00:30:49.321
In my time,

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:51.451
the best painters
might not match your skill.

00:30:51.801 --> 00:30:53.001
Don't underestimate yourself.

00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:55.800
At least you won't go hungry
in Tianguang Market.

00:30:56.971 --> 00:30:58.931
If I know you, I won't starve.

00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:00.611
Your fried rice

00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:02.721
is the best thing I've eaten so far.

00:31:04.211 --> 00:31:05.451
That's because you're hungry.

00:31:06.971 --> 00:31:07.851
Still,

00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:11.281
I should find some work.

00:31:11.451 --> 00:31:14.081
I can't keep eating on credit.

00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:16.281
No rush.

00:31:16.281 --> 00:31:17.131
Take your time.

00:31:17.131 --> 00:31:18.481
You'll find something.

00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:23.081
Miss.

00:31:23.611 --> 00:31:24.521
One fried egg.

00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:25.361
Sure.

00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:26.361
You eat first.

00:31:30.481 --> 00:31:32.281
Same as usual. More scallions and chili?

00:31:32.281 --> 00:31:33.121
Right.

00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:46.591
(I Fix Everything)

00:31:46.611 --> 00:31:47.451
Lan.

00:31:59.721 --> 00:32:01.451
Can you fix this box?

00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:04.811
It's broken here.

00:32:05.141 --> 00:32:05.999
I can fix it.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.155
I'll give you these vegetables.

00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:08.001
Sure.

00:32:08.001 --> 00:32:09.481
I'll bring it over once it's done.

00:32:09.481 --> 00:32:10.321
Sure. Thank you.

00:32:10.451 --> 00:32:11.291
You're welcome.

00:32:15.001 --> 00:32:15.841
Lan.

00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:28.841
Can I

00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:32.801
still have your fried rice today?

00:32:34.611 --> 00:32:35.451
Yes.

00:32:38.977 --> 00:32:40.666
I'll bring it to you once it's ready.

00:33:38.971 --> 00:33:39.811
What is this?

00:33:43.561 --> 00:33:44.801
Why are you making this?

00:33:47.761 --> 00:33:48.891
I don't know

00:33:49.171 --> 00:33:50.481
when I'll be able to leave.

00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:52.281
Since I have time now,

00:33:52.721 --> 00:33:54.691
I thought I'd practice a bit.

00:33:56.171 --> 00:33:57.171
Once I get out,

00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:00.761
I don't plan to study this anymore.

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:05.881
Why?

00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:07.971
I've taken the exam so many times,

00:34:08.291 --> 00:34:10.251
and never got into the university
I wanted.

00:34:11.681 --> 00:34:12.561
That means

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.971
I just don't have talent for it.

00:34:16.081 --> 00:34:17.411
I'll find any job after I leave.

00:34:18.121 --> 00:34:19.121
I guess

00:34:19.411 --> 00:34:20.481
my life will be like that.

00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:24.681
But you've put in so much effort.

00:34:25.561 --> 00:34:26.771
Isn't it a pity

00:34:27.121 --> 00:34:28.201
to give up now?

00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:29.641
It's not that much.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.666
Just a few years of exams.

00:34:41.971 --> 00:34:42.971
If I were you,

00:34:43.931 --> 00:34:44.931
I'd try again.

00:34:49.001 --> 00:34:50.851
A few years may seem long,

00:34:51.481 --> 00:34:53.291
but in a lifetime,

00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:54.601
it's not that much.

00:34:56.521 --> 00:34:57.601
Instead of giving up,

00:34:57.931 --> 00:34:59.161
why not give it a try?

00:34:59.377 --> 00:35:00.890
That way, you won't regret it later.

00:35:14.731 --> 00:35:17.331
You only spent a few years.

00:35:18.622 --> 00:35:20.080
My mother spent her entire lifetime

00:35:20.971 --> 00:35:22.371
for me.

00:35:31.681 --> 00:35:32.521
Lan,

00:35:33.251 --> 00:35:35.561
you've never told me about your past.

00:35:41.081 --> 00:35:42.971
My family were cooks for generations,

00:35:43.931 --> 00:35:46.731
but my mother didn't want me
to spend my life in taverns.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.000
She hoped I could enter
a royal residence

00:35:49.641 --> 00:35:51.081
and become the head chef.

00:35:53.771 --> 00:35:55.201
To send me a royal residence,

00:35:56.081 --> 00:35:57.851
she spent all her savings,

00:35:59.561 --> 00:36:01.001
only to fall ill from overwork

00:36:03.481 --> 00:36:04.521
and pass away.

00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:09.201
And yet,

00:36:10.161 --> 00:36:11.331
I still disappointed her.

00:36:12.177 --> 00:36:14.755
I finally entered a royal residence,
but only stayed a few days.

00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:17.561
I got lost in the back mountain.

00:36:18.201 --> 00:36:19.291
I walked into thick fog

00:36:19.731 --> 00:36:20.971
and ended up here.

00:36:24.851 --> 00:36:26.971
I don't know
when I'll be able to go back.

00:36:33.161 --> 00:36:34.001
Lan,

00:36:35.121 --> 00:36:36.371
if you wish to leave,

00:36:37.001 --> 00:36:37.931
I'll help you.

00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:41.681
If you wish to stay,

00:36:43.121 --> 00:36:44.291
I'll stay with you.

00:36:46.521 --> 00:36:47.731
If you get out,

00:36:49.371 --> 00:36:50.641
I'll leave with you.

00:37:26.081 --> 00:37:27.291
We'll steal a raft,

00:37:27.555 --> 00:37:29.370
row into the fog
in the middle of the river,

00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.681
and then we can leave.

00:37:32.081 --> 00:37:34.291
But there are guards on the raft.

00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:41.161
This is a nice place.

00:37:41.244 --> 00:37:43.066
- Follow me.
- I don't know if I'll come back.

00:37:43.066 --> 00:37:44.244
Let me take one more look.

00:37:45.641 --> 00:37:46.851
What's wrong, young man?

00:37:46.851 --> 00:37:48.041
What happened?

00:37:48.041 --> 00:37:49.041
Don't scare me.

00:37:49.041 --> 00:37:50.041
Call an ambulance now.

00:37:50.251 --> 00:37:51.091
(I remember now.)

00:37:51.251 --> 00:37:52.481
(He's Lu Feng!)

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.450
(The patient has a perforated stomach
and is unconscious.)

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.777
(Dr. Xu is preparing for surgery.)

00:38:00.844 --> 00:38:01.970
(What's the blood pressure?)

00:38:01.971 --> 00:38:03.041
(Eighty over forty-seven.)

00:38:03.041 --> 00:38:03.891
(Blood oxygen is sixty.)

00:38:03.891 --> 00:38:04.731
(Notify anesthesia.)

00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:05.731
(Okay.)

00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:10.971
Is there no other way?

00:38:13.121 --> 00:38:14.641
All we can do is treat every moment

00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:17.081
as if it were the last.

00:38:27.161 --> 00:38:28.001
I'm sorry.

00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:32.081
I couldn't take you out.

00:38:34.561 --> 00:38:35.561
It's fine.

00:38:50.177 --> 00:38:52.022
If you've grown attached to this place,

00:38:53.161 --> 00:38:55.331
you'll forget the sharp knife
from Bingzhou,

00:38:55.971 --> 00:38:57.331
and the white salt from Wu.

00:39:00.331 --> 00:39:02.081
If you remain lost in sleep,

00:39:03.601 --> 00:39:06.601
all that awaits
is withered spring blossoms

00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:08.811
and desolation.

00:39:57.351 --> 00:39:58.711

00:40:19.001 --> 00:40:19.841
Read this.

00:40:21.851 --> 00:40:24.451
(Famed Artist Lu Feng)
Has Lu Feng found his conscience?

00:40:24.451 --> 00:40:26.481
(Donates All Assets to Charity)
He's giving everything away

00:40:26.482 --> 00:40:28.333
and plans to focus on creating
from now on.

00:40:28.355 --> 00:40:31.250
Perhaps it's because Kunwu Blade
can sense one another.

00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:33.810
When Lu Feng came into contact
with the Wu Blade again,

00:40:34.201 --> 00:40:36.331
all the past memories came back.

00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:37.481
That's only natural.

00:40:39.001 --> 00:40:42.291
But even if he remembers,

00:40:42.521 --> 00:40:44.291
he can't change what already happened.

00:40:45.121 --> 00:40:46.481
Maybe it's better to forget.

00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:53.411
I'm going to be late.

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.041
Hot!

00:40:58.561 --> 00:40:59.451
Bye-bye.

00:41:00.561 --> 00:41:01.561
Thank you for the tea.

00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:24.890
(The Kun blade hasn't been found.)

00:41:25.561 --> 00:41:28.161
(The abnormal energy of the Wu Blade
can't be eliminated for now.)

00:41:39.851 --> 00:41:43.001
(Why don't you use Yashe
to take a look at his past?)

00:41:43.561 --> 00:41:45.481
(That way, you'll know)

00:41:45.481 --> 00:41:46.731
(where he came from.)

00:41:47.891 --> 00:41:49.331
(You don't have to guess then.)
